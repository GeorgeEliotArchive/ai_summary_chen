The placards and the caricature were prepared before the departure of the delegates; and it had been settled that Mat Paine, Dempsterâ€™s clerk, should ride out on Thursday morning to meet them at Whitlow, the last place where they would change horses, that he might gallop back and prepare an ovation for the triumvirate in case of their success. Dempster had determined to dine at Whitlow: so that Mat Paine was in Milby again two hours before the entrance of the delegates, and had time to send a whisper up the back streets that there was promise of a â€˜spreeâ€™ in the Bridge Way, as well as to assemble two knots of picked men--one to feed the flame of orthodox zeal with gin-and-water, at the Green Man, near High Street; the other to solidify their church principles with heady beer at the Bear and Ragged Staff in the Bridge Way. </p><p>The Bridge Way was an irregular straggling street, where the town fringed off raggedly into the Whitlow road: rows of new red-brick houses, in which ribbon-looms were rattling behind long lines of window, alternating with old, half-thatched, half-tiled cottages--one of those dismal wide streets where dirt and misery have no long shadows thrown on them to soften their ugliness. Here, about half-past five oâ€™clock, Silly Caleb, an idiot well known in Dog Lane, but more of a stranger in the Bridge Way, was seen slouching along with a string of boys hooting at his heels; presently another group, for the most part out at elbows, came briskly in the same direction, looking round them with an air of expectation; and at no long interval, Deb Traunter, in a pink flounced gown and floating ribbons, was observed talking with great affability to two men in seal-skin caps and fustian, who formed her cortege. The Bridge Way began to have a presentiment of something in the wind. Phib Cook left her evening wash-tub and appeared at her door in soap-suds, a bonnet-poke, and general dampness; three narrow-chested ribbon-weavers, in rusty black streaked with shreds of many-coloured silk, sauntered out with their hands in their pockets; and Molly Beale, a brawny old virago, descrying wiry Dame Ricketts peeping out from her entry, seized the opportunity of renewing the morningâ€™s skirmish. In short, the Bridge Way was in that state of excitement which is understood to announce a â€˜demonstrationâ€™ on the part of the British public; and the afflux of remote townsmen increasing, there was soon so large a crowd that it was time for Bill Powers, a plethoric Goliath, who presided over the knot of beer-drinkers at the Bear and Ragged Staff, to issue forth with his companions, and, like the enunciator of the ancient myth, make the assemblage distinctly conscious of the common sentiment that had drawn them together. The expectation of the delegatesâ€™ chaise, added to the fight between Molly Beale and Dame Ricketts, and the ill-advised appearance of a lean bull-terrier, were a sufficient safety-valve to the popular excitement during the remaining quarter of an hour; at the end of which the chaise was seen approaching along the Whitlow road, with oak boughs ornamenting the horsesâ€™ heads; and, to quote the account of this interesting scene which was sent to the <em>Rotherby Guardian</em>, â€˜loud cheers immediately testified to the sympathy of the honest fellows collected there, with the public-spirited exertions of their fellow-townsmen.â€™ Bill Powers, whose bloodshot eyes, bent hat, and protuberant altitude, marked him out as the natural leader of the assemblage, undertook to interpret the common sentiment by stopping the chaise, advancing to the door with raised hat, and begging to know of Mr. Dempster, whether the Rector had forbidden the â€˜canting lectureâ€™. </p><p>â€˜Yes, yes,â€™ said Mr. Dempster. â€˜Keep up a jolly good hurray.â€™ </p><p>No public duty could have been more easy and agreeable to Mr. Powers and his associates, and the chorus swelled all the way to the High Street, where, by a mysterious coincidence often observable in these spontaneous â€˜demonstrationsâ€™, large placards on long poles were observed to shoot upwards from among the crowd, principally in the direction of Tuckerâ€™s Lane, where the Green Man was situated. One bore, â€˜Down with the Tryanites!â€™ another, â€˜No Cant!â€™ another, â€˜Long live our venerable Curate!â€™ and one in still larger letters, â€˜Sound Church Principles and no Hypocrisy!â€™ But a still more remarkable impromptu was a huge caricature of Mr. Tryan in gown and band, with an enormous aureole of yellow hair and upturned eyes, standing on the pulpit stairs and trying to pull down old Mr. Crewe. Groans, yells, and hisses--hisses, yells, and groans--only stemmed by the appearance of another caricature representing Mr. Tryan being pitched head-foremost from the pulpit stairs by a hand which the artist, either from subtilty of intention or want of space, had left unindicated. In the midst of the tremendous cheering that saluted this piece of symbolical art, the chaise had reached the door of the Red Lion, and loud cries of â€˜Dempster for ever!â€™ with a feebler cheer now and then for Tomlinson and Budd, were presently responded to by the appearance of the public-spirited attorney at the large upper window, where also were visible a little in the background the small sleek head of Mr. Budd, and the blinking countenance of Mr. Tomlinson. </p><p>Mr. Dempster held his hat in his hand, and poked his head forward with a butting motion by way of bow. A storm of cheers subsided at last into dropping sounds of â€˜Silence!â€™ â€˜Hear him!â€™ â€˜Go it, Dempster!â€™ and the lawyerâ€™s rasping voice became distinctly audible. </p><p>â€˜Fellow-townsmen! It gives us the sincerest pleasure--I speak for my respected colleagues as well as myself--to witness these strong proofs of your attachment to the principles of our excellent Church, and your zeal for the honour of our venerable pastor. But it is no more than I expected of you. I know you well. Iâ€™ve known you for the last twenty years to be as honest and respectable a set of ratepayers as any in this county. Your hearts are sound to the core! No man had better try to thrust his cant and hypocrisy down <em>your</em> throats. Youâ€™re used to wash them with liquor of a better flavour. This is the proudest moment in my own life, and I think I may say in that of my colleagues, in which I have to tell you that our exertions in the cause of sound religion and manly morality have been crowned with success. Yes, my fellow-townsmen! I have the gratification of announcing to you thus formally what you have already learned indirectly. The pulpit from which our venerable pastor has fed us with sound doctrine for half a century is not to be invaded by a fanatical, sectarian, double-faced, Jesuitical interloper! We are not to have our young people demoralized and corrupted by the temptations to vice, notoriously connected with Sunday evening lectures! We are not to have a preacher obtruding himself upon us, who decries good works, and sneaks into our homes perverting the faith of our wives and daughters! We are not to be poisoned with doctrines which damp every innocent enjoyment, and pick a poor manâ€™s pocket of the sixpence with which he might buy himself a cheerful glass after a hard dayâ€™s work, under pretence of paying for bibles to send to the Chicktaws! </p><p>â€˜But Iâ€™m not going to waste your valuable time with unnecessary words. I am a man of deedsâ€™ (â€˜Ay, damn you, that you are, and you charge well for â€™em too,â€™ said a voice from the crowd, probably that of a gentleman who was immediately afterwards observed with his hat crushed over his head.) â€˜I shall always be at the service of my fellow-townsmen, and whoever dares to hector over you, or interfere with your innocent pleasures, shall have an account to settle with Robert Dempster. </p><p>â€˜Now, my boys! you canâ€™t do better than disperse and carry the good news to all your fellow-townsmen, whose hearts are as sound as your own. Let some of you go one way and some another, that every man, woman, and child in Milby may know what you know yourselves. But before we part, let us have three cheers for True Religion, and down with Cant!â€™ </p><p>When the last cheer was dying, Mr. Dempster closed the window, and the judiciously-instructed placards and caricatures moved off in divers directions, followed by larger or smaller divisions of the crowd. The greatest attraction apparently lay in the direction of Dog Lane, the outlet towards Paddiford Common, whither the caricatures were moving; and you foresee, of course, that those works of symbolical art were consumed with a liberal expenditure of dry gorse-bushes and vague shouting. </p><p>After these great public exertions, it was natural that Mr. Dempster and his colleagues should feel more in need than usual of a little social relaxation; and a party of their friends was already beginning to assemble in the large parlour of the Red Lion, convened partly by their own curiosity, and partly by the invaluable Mat Paine. The most capacious punch-bowl was put in requisition; and that born gentleman, Mr. Lowme, seated opposite Mr. Dempster as â€˜Viceâ€™, undertook to brew the punch, defying the criticisms of the envious men out of office, who with the readiness of irresponsibility, ignorantly suggested more lemons. The social festivities were continued till long past midnight, when several friends of sound religion were conveyed home with some difficulty, one of them showing a dogged determination to seat himself in the gutter. </p><p>Mr. Dempster had done as much justice to the punch as any of the party; and his friend Boots, though aware that the lawyer could â€˜carry his liquor like Old Nickâ€™, with whose social demeanour Boots seemed to be particularly well acquainted, nevertheless thought it might be as well to see so good a customer in safety to his own door, and walked quietly behind his elbow out of the inn-yard. Dempster, however, soon became aware of him, stopped short, and, turning slowly round upon him, recognized the well-known drab waistcoat sleeves, conspicuous enough in the starlight. </p><p>â€˜You twopenny scoundrel! What do you mean by dogging a professional manâ€™s footsteps in this way? Iâ€™ll break every bone in your skin if you attempt to track me, like a beastly cur sniffing at oneâ€™s pocket. Do you think a gentleman will make his way home any the better for having the scent of your blacking-bottle thrust up his nostrils?â€™ </p><p>Boots slunk back, in more amusement than ill-humour, thinking the lawyerâ€™s â€˜rum talkâ€™ was doubtless part and parcel of his professional ability; and Mr. Dempster pursued his slow way alone. </p><p>His house lay in Orchard Street, which opened on the prettiest outskirt of the town--the church, the parsonage, and a long stretch of green fields. It was an old-fashioned house, with an overhanging upper storey; outside, it had a face of rough stucco, and casement windows with green frames and shutters; inside, it was full of long passages, and rooms with low ceilings. There was a large heavy knocker on the green door, and though Mr. Dempster carried a latch-key, he sometimes chose to use the knocker. He chose to do so now. The thunder resounded through Orchard Street, and, after a single minute, there was a second clap louder than the first. Another minute, and still the door was not opened; whereupon Mr. Dempster, muttering, took out his latch-key, and, with less difficulty than might have been expected, thrust it into the door. When he opened the door the passage was dark. </p><p>â€˜Janet!â€™ in the loudest rasping tone, was the next sound that rang through the house. </p><p>â€˜Janet!â€™ again--before a slow step was heard on the stairs, and a distant light began to flicker on the wall of the passage. </p><p>â€˜Curse you! you creeping idiot! Come faster, canâ€™t you?â€™ </p><p>Yet a few seconds, and the figure of a tall woman, holding aslant a heavy-plated drawing-room candlestick, appeared at the turning of the passage that led to the broader entrance. </p><p>She had on a light dress which sat loosely about her figure, but did not disguise its liberal, graceful outline. A heavy mass of straight jet-black hair had escaped from its fastening, and hung over her shoulders. Her grandly-cut features, pale with the natural paleness of a brunette, had premature lines about them, telling that the years had been lengthened by sorrow, and the delicately-curved nostril, which seemed made to quiver with the proud consciousness of power and beauty, must have quivered to the heart-piercing griefs which had given that worn look to the corners of the mouth. Her wide open black eyes had a strangely fixed, sightless gaze, as she paused at the turning, and stood silent before her husband. </p><p>â€˜Iâ€™ll teach you to keep me waiting in the dark, you pale staring fool!â€™ he said, advancing with his slow drunken step. â€˜What, youâ€™ve been drinking again, have you? Iâ€™ll beat you into your senses.â€™ </p><p>He laid his hand with a firm grip on her shoulder, turned her round, and pushed her slowly before him along the passage and through the dining-room door, which stood open on their left hand. </p><p>There was a portrait of Janetâ€™s mother, a grey-haired, dark-eyed old woman, in a neatly fluted cap, hanging over the mantelpiece. Surely the aged eyes take on a look of anguish as they see Janet--not trembling, no! it would be better if she trembled--standing stupidly unmoved in her great beauty while the heavy arm is lifted to strike her. The blow falls--another--and another. Surely the mother hears that cry--â€˜O Robert! pity! pity!â€™ </p><p>Poor grey-haired woman! Was it for this you suffered a motherâ€™s pangs in your lone widowhood five-and-thirty years ago? Was it for this you kept the little worn morocco shoes Janet had first run in, and kissed them day by day when she was away from you, a tall girl at school? Was it for this you looked proudly at her when she came back to you in her rich pale beauty, like a tall white arum that has just unfolded its grand pure curves to the sun? </p><p>The mother lies sleepless and praying in her lonely house, weeping the difficult tears of age, because she dreads this may be a cruel night for her child. </p><p>She too has a picture over her mantelpiece, drawn in chalk by Janet long years ago. She looked at it before she went to bed. It is a head bowed beneath a cross, and wearing a crown of thorns.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/ai_summary_chen/Scenes of Clerical Life/BOOK III/Chapter 3"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Chapter 3</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/ai_summary_chen/Scenes of Clerical Life/BOOK III/Chapter 5"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Chapter 5</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#chapter-4" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Chapter 4</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div>

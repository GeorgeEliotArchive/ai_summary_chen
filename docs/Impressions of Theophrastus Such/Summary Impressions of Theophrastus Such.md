### THE WASP CREDITED WITH THE HONEYCOMB
:::note
**Summary**:
In this chapter, George Eliot discusses the idea of plagiarism, the claiming of others’ ideas as one’s own, and intellectual property. The author uses the character Euphorion to examine the fine line between originality and plagiarism, particularly when ideas are considered public domain. The author points out that humans are prone to inadvertently claim others' ideas as their own due to memory lapse, ego, or the desire for recognition. They further argue that accusations of plagiarism are difficult to prove due the shared ideas in contemporary thinking and memory lapses. The text emphasizes that one's reputation and preconceived notions about a person often weigh heavier in accusations of plagiarism than the actual act itself. The chapter concludes with a fable about animals trying to determine who created a honeycomb, symbolizing the difficulty in assigning intellectual property.

** Significant Quotations**:
To lay false claim to an invention or discovery which has an immediate market value; to vamp up a professedly new book of reference by stealing from the pages of one already produced at the cost of much labour and material; to copy somebody else's poem and send the manuscript to a magazine, or hand it about among friends as an original 'effusion;' to deliver an elegant extract from a known writer as a piece of improvised eloquence:--these are the limits within which the dishonest pretence of originality is likely to get hissed or hooted and bring more or less shame on the culprit.

** Chapter Keywords**:
['Intellectual property', 'Plagiarism', 'Recognition', 'Judgment', 'False reasoning', 'Fable', 'Honeycomb']

** Chapter Notes**:
This chapter focuses on the theme of intellectual property and the importance of giving credit to the original creators of ideas, as well as the consequences of not acknowledging the true originators of ideas.

### SO YOUNG!
:::note
**Summary**:
In this chapter, George Eliot discusses the character Ganymede, who is obsessed with maintaining the illusion of his youth despite his advancing age. Ganymede’s fixation on staying young originates from both his personal experiences and prolonged societal reinforcement of his false self-perception. Despite getting older and even marrying a woman much older than him, Ganymede persists in considering himself very young. Critics also contribute to this delusion by repeatedly mentioning his youthfulness whenever they discuss his work. Despite changes in his appearance and certain signs of aging, Ganymede fails to recognize his true age, instead, keeping up his youthful demeanor and attitude. The chapter concludes with an observation that there can be both male and female versions of people who desperately cling onto their imagined youthfulness.

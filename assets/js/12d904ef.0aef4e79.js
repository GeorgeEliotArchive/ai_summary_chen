Ah! you can make that lute discourse, I perceive. I, too, have some skill that way, though the serenata is useless when daylight discloses a visage like mine, looking no fresher than an apple that has stood the winter.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cA symbolical picture, I see,\u201d said the young Greek, touching the lute while he spoke, so as to bring out a slight musical murmur. \u201cThe child, perhaps, is the Golden Age, wanting neither worship nor philosophy. And the Golden Age can always come back as long as men are born in the form of babies, and don\u2019t come into the world in cassock or furred mantle.

He has been asked to paint a picture after the sketch, but he puts his fingers to his ears and shakes his head at that; the fancy is past, he says\u2014a strange animal, our Piero. But now all is ready for your initiation into the mysteries of the razor.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cMysteries they may well be called,\u201d continued the barber, with rising spirits at the prospect of a long monologue, as he imprisoned the young Greek in the shroud-like shaving-cloth; \u201cmysteries of Minerva and the Graces. I get the flower of men\u2019s thoughts, because I seize them in the first moment after shaving. (Ah! you wince a little at the lather: it tickles the outlying limits of the nose, I admit.) And that is what makes the peculiar fitness of a barber\u2019s shop to become a resort of wit and learning. For, look now at a druggist\u2019s shop: there is a dull conclave at the sign of \u2018The Moor,\u2019 that pretends to rival mine; but what sort of inspiration, I beseech you, can be got from the scent of nauseous vegetable decoctions?\u2014to say nothing of the fact that you no sooner pass the threshold than you see a doctor of physic, like a gigantic spider disguised in fur and scarlet, waiting for his prey; or even see him blocking up the doorway seated on a bony hack, inspecting saliva. (Your chin a little elevated, if it please you: contemplate that angel who is blowing the trumpet at you from the ceiling. I had it painted expressly for the regulation of my clients\u2019 chins.) Besides, your druggist, who herborises and decocts, is a man of prejudices: he has poisoned people according to a system, and is obliged to stand up for his system to justify the consequences. Now a barber can be dispassionate; the only thing he necessarily stands by is the razor, always providing he is not an author. That was the flaw in my great predecessor Burchiello: he was a poet, and had consequently a prejudice about his own poetry. I have escaped that; I saw very early that authorship is a narrowing business, in conflict with the liberal art of the razor, which demands an impartial affection for all men\u2019s chins. Ecco, Messer! the outline of your chin and lip is as clear as a maiden\u2019s; and now fix your mind on a knotty question\u2014ask yourself whether you are bound to spell Virgil with an ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"i")," or an ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"e"),", and say if you do not feel an unwonted clearness on the point.

If your Florentine patrons of learning share this scholarly hostility to the Greeks, I see not how your city can be a hospitable refuge for me, as you seemed to say just now.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201c",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Pian piano"),"\u2014not so fast,\u201d said Nello, sticking his thumbs into his belt and nodding to Sandro to restore order. \u201cI will not conceal from you that there is a prejudice against Greeks among us; and though, as a barber unsnared by authorship, I share no prejudices, I must admit that the Greeks are not always such pretty youngsters as yourself: their erudition is often of an uncombed, unmannerly aspect, and encrusted with a barbarous utterance of Italian, that makes their converse hardly more euphonious than that of a Tedesco in a state of vinous loquacity. And then, again, excuse me\u2014we Florentines have liberal ideas about speech, and consider that an instrument which can flatter and promise so cleverly as the tongue, must have been partly made for those purposes; and that truth is a riddle for eyes and wit to discover, which it were a mere spoiling of sport for the tongue to betray. Still we have our limits beyond which we call dissimulation treachery. But it is said of the Greeks that their honesty begins at what is the hanging point with us, and that since the old Furies went to sleep, your Christian Greek is of so easy a conscience that he would make a stepping-stone of his father\u2019s corpse.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"The flush on the stranger\u2019s face indicated what seemed so natural a movement of resentment, that the good-natured Nello hastened to atone for his want of reticence.

Heaven forbid I should fetter my impartiality by entertaining an opinion. And for that same scholarly objection to the Greeks,\u201d added Nello, in a more mocking tone, and with a significant grimace, \u201cthe fact is, you are heretics, Messer; jealousy has nothing to do with it: if you would just change your opinion about leaven, and alter your Doxology a little, our Italian scholars would think it a thousand years till they could give up their chairs to you. Yes, yes; it is chiefly religious scruple, and partly also the authority of a great classic,\u2014Juvenal, is it not? He, I gather, had his bile as much stirred by the swarm of Greeks as our Messer Angelo, who is fond of quoting some passage about their incorrigible impudence\u2014",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"audacia perdita"),".\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cPooh! the passage is a compliment,\u201d said the Greek, who had recovered himself, and seemed wise enough to take the matter gaily\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201c\u2018Ingenium velox, audacia perdita, sermo Promptus, et Isaeo torrentior.\u2019 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cA rapid intellect and ready eloquence may carry off a little impudence.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cAssuredly,\u201d said Nello. \u201cAnd since, as I see, you know Latin literature as well as Greek, you will not fall into the mistake of Giovanni Argiropulo, who ran full tilt against Cicero, and pronounced him all but a pumpkin-head. For, let me give you one bit of advice, young man\u2014trust a barber who has shaved the best chins, and kept his eyes and ears open for twenty years\u2014oil your tongue well when you talk of the ancient Latin writers, and give it an extra dip when you talk of the modern. A wise Greek may win favour among us; witness our excellent Demetrio, who is loved by many, and not hated immoderately even by the most renowned scholars.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cI discern the wisdom of your advice so clearly,\u201d said the Greek, with the bright smile which was continually lighting up the fine form and colour of his young face, \u201cthat I will ask you for a little more. Who now, for example, would be the most likely patron for me? Is there a son of Lorenzo who inherits his tastes? Or is there any other wealthy Florentine specially addicted to purchasing antique gems? I have a fine Cleopatra cut in sardonyx, and one or two other intaglios and cameos, both curious and beautiful, worthy of being added to the cabinet of a prince. Happily, I had taken the precaution of fastening them within the lining of my doublet before I set out on my voyage. Moreover, I should like to raise a small sum for my present need on this ring of mine,\u201d (here he took out the ring and replaced it on his finger), \u201cif you could recommend me to any honest trafficker.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cLet us see, let us see,\u201d said Nello, perusing the floor, and walking up and down the length of his shop. \u201cThis is no time to apply to Piero de\u2019 Medici, though he has the will to make such purchases if he could always spare the money; but I think it is another sort of Cleopatra that he covets most... Yes, yes, I have it. What you want is a man of wealth, and influence, and scholarly tastes\u2014not one of your learned porcupines, bristling all over with critical tests, but one whose Greek and Latin are of a comfortable laxity. And that man is Bartolommeo Scala, the secretary of our Republic. He came to Florence as a poor adventurer himself\u2014a miller\u2019s son\u2014a \u2018branny monster,\u2019 as he has been nicknamed by our honey-lipped Poliziano, who agrees with him as well as my teeth agree with lemon-juice. And, by the by, that may be a reason why the secretary may be the more ready to do a good turn to a strange scholar. For, between you and me, ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"bel giovane"),"\u2014trust a barber who has shaved the best scholars\u2014friendliness is much such a steed as Ser Benghi\u2019s: it will hardly show much alacrity unless it has got the thistle of hatred under its tail. However, the secretary is a man who\u2019ll keep his word to you, even to the halving of a fennel-seed; and he is not unlikely to buy some of your gems.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cBut how am I to get at this great man?\u201d said the Greek, rather impatiently.

But in the meantime, I could take you to a man who, if he has a mind, can help you to a chance of a favourable interview with Scala sooner than anybody else in Florence\u2014worth seeing for his own sake too, to say nothing of his collections, or of his daughter Romola, who is as fair as the Florentine lily before it got quarrelsome and turned red.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cBut if this father of the beautiful Romola makes collections, why should he not like to buy some of my gems himself?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"Nello shrugged his shoulders. \u201cFor two good reasons\u2014want of sight to look at the gems, and want of money to pay for them.

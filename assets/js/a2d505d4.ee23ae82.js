But no word passed between him and Dorothea about the objectionable part of the will; indeed, both of them felt that the mention of it between them would be impossible. Sir James was shy, even with men, about disagreeable subjects; and the one thing that Dorothea would have chosen to say, if she had spoken on the matter at all, was forbidden to her at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of her husband\u2019s injustice. Yet she did wish that Sir James could know what had passed between her and her husband about Will Ladislaw\u2019s moral claim on the property: it would then, she thought, be apparent to him as it was to her, that her husband\u2019s strange indelicate proviso had been chiefly urged by his bitter resistance to that idea of claim, and not merely by personal feelings more difficult to talk about. Also, it must be admitted, Dorothea wished that this could be known for Will\u2019s sake, since her friends seemed to think of him as simply an object of Mr. Casaubon\u2019s charity.

In carrying out this bequest of labor to Dorothea, as in all else, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating, oppressed in the plan of transmitting his work, as he had been in executing it, by the sense of moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium: distrust of Dorothea\u2019s competence to arrange what he had prepared was subdued only by distrust of any other redactor. But he had come at last to create a trust for himself out of Dorothea\u2019s nature: she could do what she resolved to do: and he willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to erect a tomb with his name upon it. (Not that Mr. Casaubon called the future volumes a tomb; he called them the Key to all Mythologies.)

Bound by a pledge given from the depths of her pity, she would have been capable of undertaking a toil which her judgment whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of faithfulness which is a supreme use. But now her judgment, instead of being controlled by duteous devotion, was made active by the imbittering discovery that in her past union there had lurked the hidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. The living, suffering man was no longer before her to awaken her pity: there remained only the retrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been lower than she had believed, whose exorbitant claims for himself had even blinded his scrupulous care for his own character, and made him defeat his own pride by shocking men of ordinary honor. As for the property which was the sign of that broken tie, she would have been glad to be free from it and have nothing more than her original fortune which had been settled on her, if there had not been duties attached to ownership, which she ought not to flinch from. About this property many troublous questions insisted on rising: had she not been right in thinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?\u2014but was it not impossible now for her to do that act of justice?

Practically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an impatience of everything in which the parson doesn\u2019t cut the principal figure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the Hospital: a good deal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people uncomfortably aware of him. Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!\u2014he ought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the birds.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cTrue,\u201d said Dorothea. \u201cIt is hard to imagine what sort of notions our farmers and laborers get from their teaching. I have been looking into a volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at Lowick\u2014I mean, about imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the Apocalypse. I have always been thinking of the different ways in which Christianity is taught, and whenever I find one way that makes it a wider blessing than any other, I cling to that as the truest\u2014I mean that which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in the most people as sharers in it. It is surely better to pardon too much, than to condemn too much. But I should like to see Mr. Farebrother and hear him preach.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cDo,\u201d said Lydgate; \u201cI trust to the effect of that. He is very much beloved, but he has his enemies too: there are always people who can\u2019t forgive an able man for differing from them. And that money-winning business is really a blot. You don\u2019t, of course, see many Middlemarch people: but Mr. Ladislaw, who is constantly seeing Mr. Brooke, is a great friend of Mr. Farebrother\u2019s old ladies, and would be glad to sing the Vicar\u2019s praises. One of the old ladies\u2014Miss Noble, the aunt\u2014is a wonderfully quaint picture of self-forgetful goodness, and Ladislaw gallants her about sometimes. I met them one day in a back street: you know Ladislaw\u2019s look\u2014a sort of Daphnis in coat and waistcoat; and this little old maid reaching up to his arm\u2014they looked like a couple dropped out of a romantic comedy. But the best evidence about Farebrother is to see him and hear him.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"Happily Dorothea was in her private sitting-room when this conversation occurred, and there was no one present to make Lydgate\u2019s innocent introduction of Ladislaw painful to her. As was usual with him in matters of personal gossip, Lydgate had quite forgotten Rosamond\u2019s remark that she thought Will adored Mrs. Casaubon. At that moment he was only caring for what would recommend the Farebrother family; and he had purposely given emphasis to the worst that could be said about the Vicar, in order to forestall objections. In the weeks since Mr. Casaubon\u2019s death he had hardly seen Ladislaw, and he had heard no rumor to warn him that Mr. Brooke\u2019s confidential secretary was a dangerous subject with Mrs. Casaubon. When he was gone, his picture of Ladislaw lingered in her mind and disputed the ground with that question of the Lowick living. What was Will Ladislaw thinking about her? Would he hear of that fact which made her cheeks burn as they never used to do? And how would he feel when he heard it?\u2014But she could see as well as possible how he smiled down at the little old maid. An Italian with white mice!\u2014on the contrary, he was a creature who entered into every one\u2019s feelings, and could take the pressure of their thought instead of urging his own with iron resistance."))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

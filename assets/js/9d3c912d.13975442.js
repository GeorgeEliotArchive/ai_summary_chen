Tito\u2019s talent for concealment was being fast developed into something less neutral. It was still possible\u2014perhaps it might be inevitable\u2014for him to accept frankly the altered conditions, and avow Baldassarre\u2019s existence; but hardly without casting an unpleasant light backward on his original reticence as studied equivocation in order to avoid the fulfilment of a secretly recognised claim, to say nothing of his quiet settlement of himself and investment of his florins, when, it would be clear, his benefactor\u2019s fate had not been certified. It was at least provisionally wise to act as if nothing had happened, and for the present he would suspend decisive thought; there was all the night for meditation, and no one would know the precise moment at which he had received the letter. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"So he entered the room on the second storey\u2014where Romola and her father sat among the parchment and the marble, aloof from the life of the streets on holidays as well as on common days\u2014with a face only a little less bright than usual, from regret at appearing so late: a regret which wanted no testimony, since he had given up the sight of the Corso in order to express it; and then set himself to throw extra animation into the evening, though all the while his consciousness was at work like a machine with complex action, leaving deposits quite distinct from the line of talk; and by the time he descended the stone stairs and issued from the grim door in the starlight, his mind had really reached a new stage in its formation of a purpose. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"And when, the next day, after he was free from his professorial work, he turned up the Via del Cocomero towards the convent of San Marco, his purpose was fully shaped. He was going to ascertain from Fra Luca precisely how much he conjectured of the truth, and on what grounds he conjectured it; and, further, how long he was to remain at San Marco. And on that fuller knowledge he hoped to mould a statement which would in any case save him from the necessity of quitting Florence. Tito had never had occasion to fabricate an ingenious lie before: the occasion was come now\u2014the occasion which circumstance never fails to beget on tacit falsity; and his ingenuity was ready. For he had convinced himself that he was not bound to go in search of Baldassarre. He had once said that on a fair assurance of his father\u2019s existence and whereabout, he would unhesitatingly go after him. But, after all, ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"why")," was he bound to go? What, looked at closely, was the end of all life, but to extract the utmost sum of pleasure? And was not his own blooming life a promise of incomparably more pleasure, not for himself only, but for others, than the withered wintry life of a man who was past the time of keen enjoyment, and whose ideas had stiffened into barren rigidity? Those ideas had all been sown in the fresh soil of Tito\u2019s mind, and were lively germs there: that was the proper order of things\u2014the order of nature, which treats all maturity as a mere nidus for youth. Baldassarre had done his work, had had his draught of life: Tito said it was ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"his")," turn now. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"And the prospect was so vague:\u2014\u201cI think they are going to take me to Antioch:\u201d here was a vista! After a long voyage, to spend months, perhaps years, in a search for which even now there was no guarantee that it would not prove vain: and to leave behind at starting a life of distinction and love: and to find, if he found anything, the old exacting companionship which was known by rote beforehand. Certainly the gems and therefore the florins were, in a sense, Baldassarre\u2019s: in the narrow sense by which the right of possession is determined in ordinary affairs; but in that large and more radically natural view by which the world belongs to youth and strength, they were rather his who could extract the most pleasure out of them. That, he was conscious, was not the sentiment which the complicated play of human feelings had engendered in society. The men around him would expect that he should immediately apply those florins to his benefactor\u2019s rescue. But what was the sentiment of society?\u2014a mere tangle of anomalous traditions and opinions, which no wise man would take as a guide, except so far as his own comfort was concerned. Not that he cared for the florins save perhaps for Romola\u2019s sake: he would give up the florins readily enough. It was the joy that was due to him and was close to his lips, which he felt he was not bound to thrust away from him and so travel on, thirsting. Any maxims that required a man to fling away the good that was needed to make existence sweet, were only the lining of human selfishness turned outward: they were made by men who wanted others to sacrifice themselves for their sake. He would rather that Baldassarre should not suffer: he liked no one to suffer; but could any philosophy prove to him that he was bound to care for another\u2019s suffering more than for his own? To do so he must have loved Baldassarre devotedly, and he did ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"not")," love him: was that his own fault? Gratitude! seen closely, it made no valid claim: his father\u2019s life would have been dreary without him: are we convicted of a debt to men for the pleasures they give themselves? "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"Having once begun to explain away Baldassarre\u2019s claim, Tito\u2019s thought showed itself as active as a virulent acid, eating its rapid way through all the tissues of sentiment. His mind was destitute of that dread which has been erroneously decried as if it were nothing higher than a man\u2019s animal care for his own skin: that awe of the Divine Nemesis which was felt by religious pagans, and, though it took a more positive form under Christianity, is still felt by the mass of mankind simply as a vague fear at anything which is called wrong-doing. Such terror of the unseen is so far above mere sensual cowardice that it will annihilate that cowardice: it is the initial recognition of a moral law restraining desire, and checks the hard bold scrutiny of imperfect thought into obligations which can never be proved to have any sanctity in the absence of feeling. \u201cIt is good,\u201d sing the old Eumenides, in Aeschylus, \u201cthat fear should sit as the guardian of the soul, forcing it into wisdom\u2014good that men should carry a threatening shadow in their hearts under the full sunshine; else, how should they learn to revere the right?\u201d That guardianship may become needless; but only when all outward law has become needless\u2014only when duty and love have united in one stream and made a common force.

Yet fear was a strong element in Tito\u2019s nature\u2014the fear of what he believed or saw was likely to rob him of pleasure: and he had a definite fear that Fra Luca might be the means of driving him from Florence.

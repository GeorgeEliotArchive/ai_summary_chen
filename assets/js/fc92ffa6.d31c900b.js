For Milly had one weakness--don\u2019t love her any the less for it, it was a pretty woman\u2019s weakness--she was fond of dress; and often, when she was making up her own economical millinery, she had romantic visions how nice it would be to put on really handsome stylish things--to have very stiff balloon sleeves, for example, without which a woman\u2019s dress was nought in those days. You and I, too, reader, have our weakness, have we not? which makes us think foolish things now and then. Perhaps it may lie in an excessive admiration for small hands and feet, a tall lithe figure, large dark eyes, and dark silken braided hair. All these the Countess possessed, and she had, moreover, a delicately-formed nose, the least bit curved, and a clear brunette complexion. Her mouth it must be admitted, receded too much from her nose and chin and to a prophetic eye threatened \u2018nut-crackers\u2019 in advanced age.

At this moment John, the man-servant, approached Mrs. Barton with a gravy-tureen, and also with a slight odour of the stable, which usually adhered to him through his in-door functions.

Just the same sort of thing happened to me at the Princess Wengstein\u2019s one day, on a pink satin. I was in an agony. But you are so indifferent to dress; and well you may be.

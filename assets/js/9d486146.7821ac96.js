As she sat in Mrs Tulliver\u2019s arm-chair, no impartial observer could have denied that for a woman of fifty she had a very comely face and figure, though Tom and Maggie considered their aunt Glegg as the type of ugliness. It is true she despised the advantages of costume, for though, as she often observed, no woman had better clothes, it was not her way to wear her new things out before her old ones. Other women, if they liked, might have their best thread-lace in every wash; but when Mrs Glegg died, it would be found that she had better lace laid by in the right-hand drawer of her wardrobe in the Spotted Chamber than ever Mrs Wooll of St Ogg\u2019s had bought in her life, although Mrs Wooll wore her lace before it was paid for. So of her curled fronts: Mrs Glegg had doubtless the glossiest and crispest brown curls in her drawers, as well as curls in various degrees of fuzzy laxness; but to look out on the week-day world from under a crisp and glossy front would be to introduce a most dreamlike and unpleasant confusion between the sacred and the secular. Occasionally, indeed, Mrs Glegg wore one of her third-best fronts on a week-day visit, but not at a sister\u2019s house; especially not at Mrs Tulliver\u2019s, who, since her marriage, had hurt her sister\u2019s feelings greatly by wearing her own hair, though, as Mrs Glegg observed to Mrs Deane, a mother of a family, like Bessy, with a husband always going to law, might have been expected to know better. But Bessy was always weak! "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  So if Mrs Glegg\u2019s front to-day was more fuzzy and lax than usual, she had a design under it: she intended the most pointed and cutting allusion to Mrs Tulliver\u2019s bunches of blond curls, separated from each other by a due wave of smoothness on each side of the parting. Mrs Tulliver had shed tears several times at sister Glegg\u2019s unkindness on the subject of these unmatronly curls, but the consciousness of looking the handsomer for them naturally administered support. Mrs Glegg chose to wear her bonnet in the house to-day,\u2014untied and tilted slightly, of course\u2014a frequent practice of hers when she was on a visit, and happened to be in a severe humour: she didn\u2019t know what draughts there might be in strange houses. For the same reason she wore a small sable tippet, which reached just to her shoulders, and was very far from meeting across her well-formed chest, while her long neck was protected by a ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"chevaux-de-frise")," of miscellaneous frilling. One would need to be learned in the fashions of those times to know how far in the rear of them Mrs Glegg\u2019s slate-coloured silk gown must have been; but from certain constellations of small yellow spots upon it, and a mouldy odor about it suggestive of a damp clothes-chest, it was probable that it belonged to a stratum of garments just old enough to have come recently into wear. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Glegg held her large gold watch in her hand with the many-doubled chain round her fingers, and observed to Mrs Tulliver, who had just returned from a visit to the kitchen, that whatever it might be by other people\u2019s clocks and watches, it was gone half-past twelve by hers.

Mrs Tulliver never went the length of quarrelling with her, any more than a water-fowl that puts out its leg in a deprecating manner can be said to quarrel with a boy who throws stones. But this point of the dinner was a tender one, and not at all new, so that Mrs Tulliver could make the same answer she had often made before.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Glegg tossed her head and looked rather sour about the mouth at the thought of the \u201cfour-wheel.\u201d She had a strong opinion on that subject. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Sister Pullet was in tears when the one-horse chaise stopped before Mrs Tulliver\u2019s door, and it was apparently requisite that she should shed a few more before getting out; for though her husband and Mrs Tulliver stood ready to support her, she sat still and shook her head sadly, as she looked through her tears at the vague distance. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, whativer is the matter, sister?\u201d said Mrs Tulliver. She was not an imaginative woman, but it occurred to her that the large toilet-glass in sister Pullet\u2019s best bedroom was possibly broken for the second time. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  There was no reply but a further shake of the head, as Mrs Pullet slowly rose and got down from the chaise, not without casting a glance at Mr Pullet to see that he was guarding her handsome silk dress from injury. Mr Pullet was a small man, with a high nose, small twinkling eyes, and thin lips, in a fresh-looking suit of black and a white cravat, that seemed to have been tied very tight on some higher principle than that of mere personal ease. He bore about the same relation to his tall, good-looking wife, with her balloon sleeves, abundant mantle, and a large befeathered and beribboned bonnet, as a small fishing-smack bears to a brig with all its sails spread. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It is a pathetic sight and a striking example of the complexity introduced into the emotions by a high state of civilisation, the sight of a fashionably dressed female in grief. From the sorrow of a Hottentot to that of a woman in large buckram sleeves, with several bracelets on each arm, an architectural bonnet, and delicate ribbon strings, what a long series of gradations! In the enlightened child of civilisation the abandonment characteristic of grief is checked and varied in the subtlest manner, so as to present an interesting problem to the analytic mind. If, with a crushed heart and eyes half blinded by the mist of tears, she were to walk with a too devious step through a door-place, she might crush her buckram sleeves too, and the deep consciousness of this possibility produces a composition of forces by which she takes a line that just clears the door-post. Perceiving that the tears are hurrying fast, she unpins her strings and throws them languidly backward, a touching gesture, indicative, even in the deepest gloom, of the hope in future dry moments when cap-strings will once more have a charm. As the tears subside a little, and with her head leaning backward at the angle that will not injure her bonnet, she endures that terrible moment when grief, which has made all things else a weariness, has itself become weary; she looks down pensively at her bracelets, and adjusts their clasps with that pretty studied fortuity which would be gratifying to her mind if it were once more in a calm and healthy state. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Pullet brushed each door-post with great nicety, about the latitude of her shoulders (at that period a woman was truly ridiculous to an instructed eye if she did not measure a yard and a half across the shoulders), and having done that sent the muscles of her face in quest of fresh tears as she advanced into the parlour where Mrs Glegg was seated. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, sister, you\u2019re late; what\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Mrs Glegg, rather sharply, as they shook hands.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver was fond of going upstairs with her sister Pullet, and looking thoroughly at her cap before she put it on her head, and discussing millinery in general. This was part of Bessy\u2019s weakness that stirred Mrs Glegg\u2019s sisterly compassion: Bessy went far too well dressed, considering; and she was too proud to dress her child in the good clothing her sister Glegg gave her from the primeval strata of her wardrobe; it was a sin and a shame to buy anything to dress that child, if it wasn\u2019t a pair of shoes. In this particular, however, Mrs Glegg did her sister Bessy some injustice, for Mrs Tulliver had really made great efforts to induce Maggie to wear a leghorn bonnet and a dyed silk frock made out of her aunt Glegg\u2019s, but the results had been such that Mrs Tulliver was obliged to bury them in her maternal bosom; for Maggie, declaring that the frock smelt of nasty dye, had taken an opportunity of basting it together with the roast beef the first Sunday she wore it, and finding this scheme answer, she had subsequently pumped on the bonnet with its green ribbons, so as to give it a general resemblance to a sage cheese garnished with withered lettuces. I must urge in excuse for Maggie, that Tom had laughed at her in the bonnet, and said she looked like an old Judy. Aunt Pullet, too, made presents of clothes, but these were always pretty enough to please Maggie as well as her mother. Of all her sisters, Mrs Tulliver certainly preferred her sister Pullet, not without a return of preference; but Mrs Pullet was sorry Bessy had those naughty, awkward children; she would do the best she could by them, but it was a pity they weren\u2019t as good and as pretty as sister Deane\u2019s child. Maggie and Tom, on their part, thought their aunt Pullet tolerable, chiefly because she was not their aunt Glegg. Tom always declined to go more than once during his holidays to see either of them. Both his uncles tipped him that once, of course; but at his aunt Pullet\u2019s there were a great many toads to pelt in the cellar-area, so that he preferred the visit to her. Maggie shuddered at the toads, and dreamed of them horribly, but she liked her uncle Pullet\u2019s musical snuff-box. Still, it was agreed by the sisters, in Mrs Tulliver\u2019s absence, that the Tulliver blood did not mix well with the Dodson blood; that, in fact, poor Bessy\u2019s children were Tullivers, and that Tom, notwithstanding he had the Dodson complexion, was likely to be as \u201ccontrairy\u201d as his father. As for Maggie, she was the picture of her aunt Moss, Mr Tulliver\u2019s sister,\u2014a large-boned woman, who had married as poorly as could be; had no china, and had a husband who had much ado to pay his rent. But when Mrs Pullet was alone with Mrs Tulliver upstairs, the remarks were naturally to the disadvantage of Mrs Glegg, and they agreed, in confidence, that there was no knowing what sort of fright sister Jane would come out next. But their ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate")," was curtailed by the appearance of Mrs Deane with little Lucy; and Mrs Tulliver had to look on with a silent pang while Lucy\u2019s blond curls were adjusted. It was quite unaccountable that Mrs Deane, the thinnest and sallowest of all the Miss Dodsons, should have had this child, who might have been taken for Mrs Tulliver\u2019s any day. And Maggie always looked twice as dark as usual when she was by the side of Lucy. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  She did to-day, when she and Tom came in from the garden with their father and their uncle Glegg. Maggie had thrown her bonnet off very carelessly, and coming in with her hair rough as well as out of curl, rushed at once to Lucy, who was standing by her mother\u2019s knee. Certainly the contrast between the cousins was conspicuous, and to superficial eyes was very much to the disadvantage of Maggie though a connoisseur might have seen \u201cpoints\u201d in her which had a higher promise for maturity than Lucy\u2019s natty completeness. It was like the contrast between a rough, dark, overgrown puppy and a white kitten. Lucy put up the neatest little rosebud mouth to be kissed; everything about her was neat,\u2014her little round neck, with the row of coral beads; her little straight nose, not at all snubby; her little clear eyebrows, rather darker than her curls, to match hazel eyes, which looked up with shy pleasure at Maggie, taller by the head, though scarcely a year older. Maggie always looked at Lucy with delight. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  She was fond of fancying a world where the people never got any larger than children of their own age, and she made the queen of it just like Lucy, with a little crown on her head, and a little sceptre in her hand\u2014only the queen was Maggie herself in Lucy\u2019s form. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, Lucy,\u201d she burst out, after kissing her, \u201cyou\u2019ll stay with Tom and me, won\u2019t you? Oh, kiss her, Tom.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Tom, too, had come up to Lucy, but he was not going to kiss her\u2014no; he came up to her with Maggie, because it seemed easier, on the whole, than saying, \u201cHow do you do?\u201d to all those aunts and uncles. He stood looking at nothing in particular, with the blushing, awkward air and semi-smile which are common to shy boys when in company,\u2014very much as if they had come into the world by mistake, and found it in a degree of undress that was quite embarrassing. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHeyday!\u201d said aunt Glegg, with loud emphasis. \u201cDo little boys and gells come into a room without taking notice of their uncles and aunts? That wasn\u2019t the way when ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I")," was a little gell.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGo and speak to your aunts and uncles, my dears,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, looking anxious and melancholy. She wanted to whisper to Maggie a command to go and have her hair brushed. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, and how do you do? And I hope you\u2019re good children, are you?\u201d said Aunt Glegg, in the same loud, emphatic way, as she took their hands, hurting them with her large rings, and kissing their cheeks much against their desire. \u201cLook up, Tom, look up. Boys as go to boarding-schools should hold their heads up. Look at me now.\u201d Tom declined that pleasure apparently, for he tried to draw his hand away. \u201cPut your hair behind your ears, Maggie, and keep your frock on your shoulder.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Aunt Glegg always spoke to them in this loud, emphatic way, as if she considered them deaf, or perhaps rather idiotic; it was a means, she thought, of making them feel that they were accountable creatures, and might be a salutary check on naughty tendencies. Bessy\u2019s children were so spoiled\u2014they\u2019d need have somebody to make them feel their duty. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, my dears,\u201d said aunt Pullet, in a compassionate voice, \u201cyou grow wonderful fast. I doubt they\u2019ll outgrow their strength,\u201d she added, looking over their heads, with a melancholy expression, at their mother. \u201cI think the gell has too much hair. I\u2019d have it thinned and cut shorter, sister, if I was you; it isn\u2019t good for her health. It\u2019s that as makes her skin so brown, I shouldn\u2019t wonder. Don\u2019t you think so, sister Deane?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI can\u2019t say, I\u2019m sure, sister,\u201d said Mrs Deane, shutting her lips close again, and looking at Maggie with a critical eye. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, no,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, \u201cthe child\u2019s healthy enough; there\u2019s nothing ails her. There\u2019s red wheat as well as white, for that matter, and some like the dark grain best. But it \u2019ud be as well if Bessy \u2019ud have the child\u2019s hair cut, so as it \u2019ud lie smooth.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  A dreadful resolve was gathering in Maggie\u2019s breast, but it was arrested by the desire to know from her aunt Deane whether she would leave Lucy behind. Aunt Deane would hardly ever let Lucy come to see them. After various reasons for refusal, Mrs Deane appealed to Lucy herself. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like to stay behind without mother, should you, Lucy?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, please, mother,\u201d said Lucy, timidly, blushing very pink all over her little neck. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell done, Lucy! Let her stay, Mrs Deane, let her stay,\u201d said Mr Deane, a large but alert-looking man, with a type of ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"physique")," to be seen in all ranks of English society,\u2014bald crown, red whiskers, full forehead, and general solidity without heaviness. You may see noblemen like Mr Deane, and you may see grocers or day-labourers like him; but the keenness of his brown eyes was less common than his contour. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He held a silver snuff-box very tightly in his hand, and now and then exchanged a pinch with Mr Tulliver, whose box was only silver-mounted, so that it was naturally a joke between them that Mr Tulliver wanted to exchange snuff-boxes also. Mr Deane\u2019s box had been given him by the superior partners in the firm to which he belonged, at the same time that they gave him a share in the business, in acknowledgment of his valuable services as manager. No man was thought more highly of in St Ogg\u2019s than Mr Deane; and some persons were even of opinion that Miss Susan Dodson, who was once held to have made the worst match of all the Dodson sisters, might one day ride in a better carriage, and live in a better house, even than her sister Pullet. There was no knowing where a man would stop, who had got his foot into a great mill-owning, ship-owning business like that of Guest & Co., with a banking concern attached. And Mrs Deane, as her intimate female friends observed, was proud and \u201chaving\u201d enough; ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"she")," wouldn\u2019t let her husband stand still in the world for want of spurring. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMaggie,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, beckoning Maggie to her, and whispering in her ear, as soon as this point of Lucy\u2019s staying was settled, \u201cgo and get your hair brushed, do, for shame. I told you not to come in without going to Martha first, you know I did.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTom come out with me,\u201d whispered Maggie, pulling his sleeve as she passed him; and Tom followed willingly enough. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCome upstairs with me, Tom,\u201d she whispered, when they were outside the door. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to do before dinner.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere\u2019s no time to play at anything before dinner,\u201d said Tom, whose imagination was impatient of any intermediate prospect. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh yes, there is time for this; ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"do")," come, Tom.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Tom followed Maggie upstairs into her mother\u2019s room, and saw her go at once to a drawer, from which she took out a large pair of scissors. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat are they for, Maggie?\u201d said Tom, feeling his curiosity awakened. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie answered by seizing her front locks and cutting them straight across the middle of her forehead. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, my buttons! Maggie, you\u2019ll catch it!\u201d exclaimed Tom; \u201cyou\u2019d better not cut any more off.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Snip! went the great scissors again while Tom was speaking, and he couldn\u2019t help feeling it was rather good fun; Maggie would look so queer. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHere, Tom, cut it behind for me,\u201d said Maggie, excited by her own daring, and anxious to finish the deed. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019ll catch it, you know,\u201d said Tom, nodding his head in an admonitory manner, and hesitating a little as he took the scissors. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNever mind, make haste!\u201d said Maggie, giving a little stamp with her foot. Her cheeks were quite flushed. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The black locks were so thick, nothing could be more tempting to a lad who had already tasted the forbidden pleasure of cutting the pony\u2019s mane. I speak to those who know the satisfaction of making a pair of scissors meet through a duly resisting mass of hair. One delicious grinding snip, and then another and another, and the hinder-locks fell heavily on the floor, and Maggie stood cropped in a jagged, uneven manner, but with a sense of clearness and freedom, as if she had emerged from a wood into the open plain. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, Maggie,\u201d said Tom, jumping round her, and slapping his knees as he laughed, \u201cOh, my buttons! what a queer thing you look! Look at yourself in the glass; you look like the idiot we throw out nutshells to at school.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie felt an unexpected pang. She had thought beforehand chiefly at her own deliverance from her teasing hair and teasing remarks about it, and something also of the triumph she should have over her mother and her aunts by this very decided course of action; she didn\u2019t want her hair to look pretty,\u2014that was out of the question,\u2014she only wanted people to think her a clever little girl, and not to find fault with her. But now, when Tom began to laugh at her, and say she was like an idiot, the affair had quite a new aspect. She looked in the glass, and still Tom laughed and clapped his hands, and Maggie\u2019s cheeks began to pale, and her lips to tremble a little. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, Maggie, you\u2019ll have to go down to dinner directly,\u201d said Tom. \u201cOh, my!\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me, Tom,\u201d said Maggie, in a passionate tone, with an outburst of angry tears, stamping, and giving him a push. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow, then, spitfire!\u201d said Tom. \u201cWhat did you cut it off for, then? I shall go down: I can smell the dinner going in.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He hurried downstairs and left poor Maggie to that bitter sense of the irrevocable which was almost an everyday experience of her small soul. She could see clearly enough, now the thing was done, that it was very foolish, and that she should have to hear and think more about her hair than ever; for Maggie rushed to her deeds with passionate impulse, and then saw not only their consequences, but what would have happened if they had not been done, with all the detail and exaggerated circumstance of an active imagination. Tom never did the same sort of foolish things as Maggie, having a wonderful instinctive discernment of what would turn to his advantage or disadvantage; and so it happened, that though he was much more wilful and inflexible than Maggie, his mother hardly ever called him naughty. But if Tom did make a mistake of that sort, he espoused it, and stood by it: he \u201cdidn\u2019t mind.\u201d If he broke the lash of his father\u2019s gigwhip by lashing the gate, he couldn\u2019t help it,\u2014the whip shouldn\u2019t have got caught in the hinge. If Tom Tulliver whipped a gate, he was convinced, not that the whipping of gates by all boys was a justifiable act, but that he, Tom Tulliver, was justifiable in whipping that particular gate, and he wasn\u2019t going to be sorry. But Maggie, as she stood crying before the glass, felt it impossible that she should go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes and severe words of her aunts, while Tom and Lucy, and Martha, who waited at table, and perhaps her father and her uncles, would laugh at her; for if Tom had laughed at her, of course every one else would; and if she had only let her hair alone, she could have sat with Tom and Lucy, and had the apricot pudding and the custard! What could she do but sob? She sat as helpless and despairing among her black locks as Ajax among the slaughtered sheep. Very trivial, perhaps, this anguish seems to weather-worn mortals who have to think of Christmas bills, dead loves, and broken friendships; but it was not less bitter to Maggie\u2014perhaps it was even more bitter\u2014than what we are fond of calling antithetically the real troubles of mature life. \u201cAh, my child, you will have real troubles to fret about by and by,\u201d is the consolation we have almost all of us had administered to us in our childhood, and have repeated to other children since we have been grown up. We have all of us sobbed so piteously, standing with tiny bare legs above our little socks, when we lost sight of our mother or nurse in some strange place; but we can no longer recall the poignancy of that moment and weep over it, as we do over the remembered sufferings of five or ten years ago. Every one of those keen moments has left its trace, and lives in us still, but such traces have blent themselves irrecoverably with the firmer texture of our youth and manhood; and so it comes that we can look on at the troubles of our children with a smiling disbelief in the reality of their pain. Is there any one who can recover the experience of his childhood, not merely with a memory of what he did and what happened to him, of what he liked and disliked when he was in frock and trousers, but with an intimate penetration, a revived consciousness of what he felt then, when it was so long from one Midsummer to another; what he felt when his school fellows shut him out of their game because he would pitch the ball wrong out of mere wilfulness; or on a rainy day in the holidays, when he didn\u2019t know how to amuse himself, and fell from idleness into mischief, from mischief into defiance, and from defiance into sulkiness; or when his mother absolutely refused to let him have a tailed coat that \u201chalf,\u201d although every other boy of his age had gone into tails already? Surely if we could recall that early bitterness, and the dim guesses, the strangely perspectiveless conception of life, that gave the bitterness its intensity, we should not pooh-pooh the griefs of our children. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMiss Maggie, you\u2019re to come down this minute,\u201d said Kezia, entering the room hurriedly. \u201cLawks! what have you been a-doing?

He was not inclined to cry, and did not feel that Maggie\u2019s grief spoiled his prospect of the sweets; but he went and put his head near her, and said in a lower, comforting tone,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWon\u2019t you come, then, Magsie?

His good nature had taken off the keenest edge of her suffering, and nuts with cowslip wine began to assert their legitimate influence. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Slowly she rose from amongst her scattered locks, and slowly she made her way downstairs. Then she stood leaning with one shoulder against the frame of the dining-parlour door, peeping in when it was ajar. She saw Tom and Lucy with an empty chair between them, and there were the custards on a side-table; it was too much. She slipped in and went toward the empty chair. But she had no sooner sat down than she repented and wished herself back again. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver gave a little scream as she saw her, and felt such a \u201cturn\u201d that she dropped the large gravy-spoon into the dish, with the most serious results to the table-cloth. For Kezia had not betrayed the reason of Maggie\u2019s refusal to come down, not liking to give her mistress a shock in the moment of carving, and Mrs Tulliver thought there was nothing worse in question than a fit of perverseness, which was inflicting its own punishment by depriving Maggie of half her dinner. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver\u2019s scream made all eyes turn towards the same point as her own, and Maggie\u2019s cheeks and ears began to burn, while uncle Glegg, a kind-looking, white-haired old gentleman, said,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHeyday! what little gell\u2019s this?

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie seemed to be listening to a chorus of reproach and derision. Her first flush came from anger, which gave her a transient power of defiance, and Tom thought she was braving it out, supported by the recent appearance of the pudding and custard. Under this impression, he whispered, \u201cOh, my! Maggie, I told you you\u2019d catch it.\u201d He meant to be friendly, but Maggie felt convinced that Tom was rejoicing in her ignominy. Her feeble power of defiance left her in an instant, her heart swelled, and getting up from her chair, she ran to her father, hid her face on his shoulder, and burst out into loud sobbing. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCome, come, my wench,\u201d said her father, soothingly, putting his arm round her, \u201cnever mind; you was i\u2019 the right to cut it off if it plagued you; give over crying; father\u2019ll take your part.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Delicious words of tenderness! Maggie never forgot any of these moments when her father \u201ctook her part\u201d; she kept them in her heart, and thought of them long years after, when every one else said that her father had done very ill by his children. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHow your husband does spoil that child, Bessy!\u201d said Mrs Glegg, in a loud \u201caside,\u201d to Mrs Tulliver. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the ruin of her, if you don\u2019t take care.

She took no notice of her sister\u2019s remark, but threw back her capstrings and dispensed the pudding, in mute resignation. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  With the dessert there came entire deliverance for Maggie, for the children were told they might have their nuts and wine in the summer-house, since the day was so mild; and they scampered out among the budding bushes of the garden with the alacrity of small animals getting from under a burning glass. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver had her special reason for this permission: now the dinner was despatched, and every one\u2019s mind disengaged, it was the right moment to communicate Mr Tulliver\u2019s intention concerning Tom, and it would be as well for Tom himself to be absent. The children were used to hear themselves talked of as freely as if they were birds, and could understand nothing, however they might stretch their necks and listen; but on this occasion Mrs Tulliver manifested an unusual discretion, because she had recently had evidence that the going to school to a clergyman was a sore point with Tom, who looked at it as very much on a par with going to school to a constable. Mrs Tulliver had a sighing sense that her husband would do as he liked, whatever sister Glegg said, or sister Pullet either; but at least they would not be able to say, if the thing turned out ill, that Bessy had fallen in with her husband\u2019s folly without letting her own friends know a word about it. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMr Tulliver,\u201d she said, interrupting her husband in his talk with Mr Deane, \u201cit\u2019s time now to tell the children\u2019s aunts and uncles what you\u2019re thinking of doing with Tom, isn\u2019t it?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cVery well,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, rather sharply, \u201cI\u2019ve no objections to tell anybody what I mean to do with him.

It was equally astonishing to the aunts and uncles to find a parson introduced into Mr Tulliver\u2019s family arrangements. As for uncle Pullet, he could hardly have been more thoroughly obfuscated if Mr Tulliver had said that he was going to send Tom to the Lord Chancellor; for uncle Pullet belonged to that extinct class of British yeoman who, dressed in good broadcloth, paid high rates and taxes, went to church, and ate a particularly good dinner on Sunday, without dreaming that the British constitution in Church and State had a traceable origin any more than the solar system and the fixed stars. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It is melancholy, but true, that Mr Pullet had the most confused idea of a bishop as a sort of a baronet, who might or might not be a clergyman; and as the rector of his own parish was a man of high family and fortune, the idea that a clergyman could be a schoolmaster was too remote from Mr Pullet\u2019s experience to be readily conceivable. I know it is difficult for people in these instructed times to believe in uncle Pullet\u2019s ignorance; but let them reflect on the remarkable results of a great natural faculty under favouring circumstances. And uncle Pullet had a great natural faculty for ignorance. He was the first to give utterance to his astonishment. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, what can you be going to send him to a parson for?\u201d he said, with an amazed twinkling in his eyes, looking at Mr Glegg and Mr Deane, to see if they showed any signs of comprehension. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, because the parsons are the best schoolmasters, by what I can make out,\u201d said poor Mr Tulliver, who, in the maze of this puzzling world, laid hold of any clue with great readiness and tenacity. \u201cJacobs at th\u2019 academy\u2019s no parson, and he\u2019s done very bad by the boy; and I made up my mind, if I send him to school again, it should be to somebody different to Jacobs. And this Mr Stelling, by what I can make out, is the sort o\u2019 man I want. And I mean my boy to go to him at Midsummer,\u201d he concluded, in a tone of decision, tapping his snuff-box and taking a pinch. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay a swinging half-yearly bill, then, eh, Tulliver? The clergymen have highish notions, in general,\u201d said Mr Deane, taking snuff vigorously, as he always did when wishing to maintain a neutral position. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat! do you think the parson\u2019ll teach him to know a good sample o\u2019 wheat when he sees it, neighbour Tulliver?\u201d said Mr Glegg, who was fond of his jest, and having retired from business, felt that it was not only allowable but becoming in him to take a playful view of things. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, you see, I\u2019ve got a plan i\u2019 my head about Tom,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, pausing after that statement and lifting up his glass. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, if I may be allowed to speak, and it\u2019s seldom as I am,\u201d said Mrs Glegg, with a tone of bitter meaning, \u201cI should like to know what good is to come to the boy by bringin\u2019 him up above his fortin.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, not looking at Mrs Glegg, but at the male part of his audience, \u201cyou see, I\u2019ve made up my mind not to bring Tom up to my own business. I\u2019ve had my thoughts about it all along, and I made up my mind by what I saw with Garnett and ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"his")," son. I mean to put him to some business as he can go into without capital, and I want to give him an eddication as he\u2019ll be even wi\u2019 the lawyers and folks, and put me up to a notion now an\u2019 then.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Glegg emitted a long sort of guttural sound with closed lips, that smiled in mingled pity and scorn. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt \u2019ud be a fine deal better for some people,\u201d she said, after that introductory note, \u201cif they\u2019d let the lawyers alone.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIs he at the head of a grammar school, then, this clergyman, such as that at Market Bewley?\u201d said Mr Deane. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, nothing of that,\u201d said Mr Tulliver. \u201cHe won\u2019t take more than two or three pupils, and so he\u2019ll have the more time to attend to \u2019em, you know.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, and get his eddication done the sooner; they can\u2019t learn much at a time when there\u2019s so many of \u2019em,\u201d said uncle Pullet, feeling that he was getting quite an insight into this difficult matter. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut he\u2019ll want the more pay, I doubt,\u201d said Mr Glegg. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, ay, a cool hundred a year, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, with some pride at his own spirited course. \u201cBut then, you know, it\u2019s an investment; Tom\u2019s eddication \u2019ull be so much capital to him.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, there\u2019s something in that,\u201d said Mr Glegg. \u201cWell well, neighbour Tulliver, you may be right, you may be right: "),(0,o.yg)("pre",null,(0,o.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre"},"   \u2018When land is gone and money\u2019s spent,      Then learning is most excellent.\u2019 \n")),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI remember seeing those two lines wrote on a window at Buxton.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI can give no account of it, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Mrs Deane, closing her lips very tightly again. Mrs Deane was not a woman to take part in a scene where missiles were flying. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, speaking all the more cheerfully, that Mrs Glegg might see he didn\u2019t mind her, \u201cif Wakem thinks o\u2019 sending his son to a clergyman, depend on it I shall make no mistake i\u2019 sending Tom to one. Wakem\u2019s as big a scoundrel as Old Harry ever made, but he knows the length of every man\u2019s foot he\u2019s got to deal with.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  No proposition could have been more seasonable. Mr Tulliver felt very much as if the air had been cleared of obtrusive flies now the women were out of the room. There were few things he liked better than a chat with Mr Deane, whose close application to business allowed the pleasure very rarely. Mr Deane, he considered, was the \u201cknowingest\u201d man of his acquaintance, and he had besides a ready causticity of tongue that made an agreeable supplement to Mr Tulliver\u2019s own tendency that way, which had remained in rather an inarticulate condition. And now the women were gone, they could carry on their serious talk without frivolous interruption. They could exchange their views concerning the Duke of Wellington, whose conduct in the Catholic Question had thrown such an entirely new light on his character; and speak slightingly of his conduct at the battle of Waterloo, which he would never have won if there hadn\u2019t been a great many Englishmen at his back, not to speak of Blucher and the Prussians, who, as Mr Tulliver had heard from a person of particular knowledge in that matter, had come up in the very nick of time; though here there was a slight dissidence, Mr Deane remarking that he was not disposed to give much credit to the Prussians,\u2014the build of their vessels, together with the unsatisfactory character of transactions in Dantzic beer, inclining him to form rather a low view of Prussian pluck generally. Rather beaten on this ground, Mr Tulliver proceeded to express his fears that the country could never again be what it used to be; but Mr Deane, attached to a firm of which the returns were on the increase, naturally took a more lively view of the present, and had some details to give concerning the state of the imports, especially in hides and spelter, which soothed Mr Tulliver\u2019s imagination by throwing into more distant perspective the period when the country would become utterly the prey of Papists and Radicals, and there would be no more chance for honest men. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Uncle Pullet sat by and listened with twinkling eyes to these high matters. He didn\u2019t understand politics himself,\u2014thought they were a natural gift,\u2014but by what he could make out, this Duke of Wellington was no better than he should be."))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

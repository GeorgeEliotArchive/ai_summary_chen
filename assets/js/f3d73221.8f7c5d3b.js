There was only one masculine face, at once youthful and beautiful, the image of which remained deeply impressed on her mind: it was that of her brother, who long years ago had taken her on his knee, kissed her, and never come back again: a fair face, with sunny hair, like her own. But the habitual attitude of her mind towards strangers\u2014a proud self-dependence and determination to ask for nothing even by a smile\u2014confirmed in her by her father\u2019s complaints against the world\u2019s injustice, was like a snowy embankment hemming in the rush of admiring surprise.

Tito\u2019s glance, on the contrary, had that gentle, beseeching admiration in it which is the most propitiating of appeals to a proud, shy woman, and is perhaps the only atonement a man can make for being too handsome. The finished fascination of his air came chiefly from the absence of demand and assumption.

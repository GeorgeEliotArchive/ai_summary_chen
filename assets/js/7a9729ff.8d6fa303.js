There is a very pleasant light in Tom\u2019s blue-gray eyes as he glances at the house-windows; that fold in his brow never disappears, but it is not unbecoming; it seems to imply a strength of will that may possibly be without harshness, when the eyes and mouth have their gentlest expression. His firm step becomes quicker, and the corners of his mouth rebel against the compression which is meant to forbid a smile. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The eyes in the parlour were not turned toward the bridge just then, and the group there was sitting in unexpectant silence,\u2014Mr Tulliver in his arm-chair, tired with a long ride, and ruminating with a worn look, fixed chiefly on Maggie, who was bending over her sewing while her mother was making the tea. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  They all looked up with surprise when they heard the well-known foot. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, what\u2019s up now, Tom?\u201d said his father. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit earlier than usual.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, there was nothing more for me to do, so I came away. Well, mother!\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Tom went up to his mother and kissed her, a sign of unusual good-humour with him. Hardly a word or look had passed between him and Maggie in all the three weeks; but his usual incommunicativeness at home prevented this from being noticeable to their parents.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  That was a cutting word to Maggie. Her heart had leaped with the sudden conviction that Tom was going to tell their father the debts could be paid; and Tom would have let her be absent when that news was told! But she carried away the tray and came back immediately. The feeling of injury on her own behalf could not predominate at that moment. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Tom drew to the corner of the table near his father when the tin box was set down and opened, and the red evening light falling on them made conspicuous the worn, sour gloom of the dark-eyed father and the suppressed joy in the face of the fair-complexioned son. The mother and Maggie sat at the other end of the table, the one in blank patience, the other in palpitating expectation. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Tulliver counted out the money, setting it in order on the table, and then said, glancing sharply at Tom: "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere now! you see I was right enough.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He paused, looking at the money with bitter despondency.

A slight electric shock seemed to pass through Mr Tulliver, and he kept his eyes fixed on Tom with a look of eager inquiry, while Maggie, unable to restrain herself, rushed to her father\u2019s side and knelt down by him. Tom was silent a little while before he went on. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cA good while ago, my uncle Glegg lent me a little money to trade with, and that has answered. I have three hundred and twenty pounds in the bank.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  His mother\u2019s arms were round his neck as soon as the last words were uttered, and she said, half crying: "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, my boy, I knew you\u2019d make iverything right again, when you got a man.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  But his father was silent; the flood of emotion hemmed in all power of speech. Both Tom and Maggie were struck with fear lest the shock of joy might even be fatal. But the blessed relief of tears came. The broad chest heaved, the muscles of the face gave way, and the gray-haired man burst into loud sobs. The fit of weeping gradually subsided, and he sat quiet, recovering the regularity of his breathing. At last he looked up at his wife and said, in a gentle tone: "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBessy, you must come and kiss me now\u2014the lad has made you amends.

But some subtle influence prevented him from foreseeing the good fortune as happening to himself. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cShake hands wi\u2019 me, my lad,\u201d he said, suddenly putting out his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a great thing when a man can be proud as he\u2019s got a good son.

Tom ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"was")," good; and in the sweet humility that springs in us all in moments of true admiration and gratitude, she felt that the faults he had to pardon in her had never been redeemed, as his faults were. She felt no jealousy this evening that, for the first time, she seemed to be thrown into the background in her father\u2019s mind. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  There was much more talk before bedtime. Mr Tulliver naturally wanted to hear all the particulars of Tom\u2019s trading adventures, and he listened with growing excitement and delight. He was curious to know what had been said on every occasion; if possible, what had been thought; and Bob Jakin\u2019s part in the business threw him into peculiar outbursts of sympathy with the triumphant knowingness of that remarkable packman. Bob\u2019s juvenile history, so far as it had come under Mr Tulliver\u2019s knowledge, was recalled with that sense of astonishing promise it displayed, which is observable in all reminiscences of the childhood of great men. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It was well that there was this interest of narrative to keep under the vague but fierce sense of triumph over Wakem, which would otherwise have been the channel his joy would have rushed into with dangerous force. Even as it was, that feeling from time to time gave threats of its ultimate mastery, in sudden bursts of irrelevant exclamation. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It was long before Mr Tulliver got to sleep that night; and the sleep, when it came, was filled with vivid dreams. At half-past five o\u2019clock in the morning, when Mrs Tulliver was already rising, he alarmed her by starting up with a sort of smothered shout, and looking round in a bewildered way at the walls of the bedroom. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mr Tulliver?\u201d said his wife. He looked at her, still with a puzzled expression, and said at last: "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh!\u2014I was dreaming\u2014did I make a noise?\u2014I thought I\u2019d got hold of him.\u201d"))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

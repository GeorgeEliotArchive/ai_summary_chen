Their sorrows are healed, and I feel that I am called back to my old work, in which I found a blessing that I have missed of late in the midst of too abundant worldly good. I know it is a vain thought to flee from the work that God appoints us, for the sake of finding a greater blessing to our own souls, as if we could choose for ourselves where we shall find the fulness of the Divine Presence, instead of seeking it where alone it is to be found, in loving obedience. But now, I believe, I have a clear showing that my work lies elsewhere\u2014at least for a time.

It struck him with surprise, for the grey eyes, usually so mild and grave, had the bright uneasy glance which accompanies suppressed agitation, and the slight flush in her cheeks, with which she had come downstairs, was heightened to a deep rose-colour. She looked as if she were only sister to Dinah. Adam was silent with surprise and conjecture for some moments, and then he said, \u201cI hope I\u2019ve not hurt or displeased you by what I\u2019ve said, Dinah. Perhaps I was making too free.

He\u2019s no heart for it yet, and it\u2019s better for others that he should keep away. Mr. Irwine thinks he\u2019s in the right not to come. It\u2019s a sorrowful letter. He asks about you and the Poysers, as he always does. There\u2019s one thing in the letter cut me a good deal: \u2018You can\u2019t think what an old fellow I feel,\u2019 he says; \u2018I make no schemes now.

This evening he had his habitual air of dreamy benignant contentment, until he came quite close to Dinah and saw the traces of tears on her delicate eyelids and eyelashes. He gave one rapid glance at his brother, but Adam was evidently quite outside the current of emotion that had shaken Dinah: he wore his everyday look of unexpectant calm. Seth tried not to let Dinah see that he had noticed her face, and only said, \u201cI\u2019m thankful you\u2019re come, Dinah, for Mother\u2019s been hungering after the sight of you all day.

And she had the whole evening to talk with Dinah alone; for there was a new room in the cottage, you remember, built nearly two years ago, in the expectation of a new inmate; and here Adam always sat when he had writing to do or plans to make. Seth sat there too this evening, for he knew his mother would like to have Dinah all to herself. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There were two pretty pictures on the two sides of the wall in the cottage. On one side there was the broad-shouldered, large-featured, hardy old woman, in her blue jacket and buff kerchief, with her dim-eyed anxious looks turned continually on the lily face and the slight form in the black dress that were either moving lightly about in helpful activity, or seated close by the old woman\u2019s arm-chair, holding her withered hand, with eyes lifted up towards her to speak a language which Lisbeth understood far better than the Bible or the hymn-book. She would scarcely listen to reading at all to-night. \u201cNay, nay, shut the book,\u201d she said. \u201cWe mun talk. I want t\u2019 know what thee was cryin\u2019 about. Hast got troubles o\u2019 thy own, like other folks?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  On the other side of the wall there were the two brothers so like each other in the midst of their unlikeness: Adam with knit brows, shaggy hair, and dark vigorous colour, absorbed in his \u201cfiguring\u201d; Seth, with large rugged features, the close copy of his brother\u2019s, but with thin, wavy, brown hair and blue dreamy eyes, as often as not looking vaguely out of the window instead of at his book, although it was a newly bought book\u2014Wesley\u2019s abridgment of Madame Guyon\u2019s life, which was full of wonder and interest for him. Seth had said to Adam, \u201cCan I help thee with anything in here to-night? I don\u2019t want to make a noise in the shop.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, lad,\u201d Adam answered, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing but what I must do myself. Thee\u2019st got thy new book to read.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  And often, when Seth was quite unconscious, Adam, as he paused after drawing a line with his ruler, looked at his brother with a kind smile dawning in his eyes. He knew \u201cth\u2019 lad liked to sit full o\u2019 thoughts he could give no account of; they\u2019d never come t\u2019 anything, but they made him happy,\u201d and in the last year or so, Adam had been getting more and more indulgent to Seth. It was part of that growing tenderness which came from the sorrow at work within him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  For Adam, though you see him quite master of himself, working hard and delighting in his work after his inborn inalienable nature, had not outlived his sorrow\u2014had not felt it slip from him as a temporary burden, and leave him the same man again. Do any of us? God forbid. It would be a poor result of all our anguish and our wrestling if we won nothing but our old selves at the end of it\u2014if we could return to the same blind loves, the same self-confident blame, the same light thoughts of human suffering, the same frivolous gossip over blighted human lives, the same feeble sense of that Unknown towards which we have sent forth irrepressible cries in our loneliness. Let us rather be thankful that our sorrow lives in us as an indestructible force, only changing its form, as forces do, and passing from pain into sympathy\u2014the one poor word which includes all our best insight and our best love. Not that this transformation of pain into sympathy had completely taken place in Adam yet. There was still a great remnant of pain, and this he felt would subsist as long as ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her")," pain was not a memory, but an existing thing, which he must think of as renewed with the light of every new morning. But we get accustomed to mental as well as bodily pain, without, for all that, losing our sensibility to it. It becomes a habit of our lives, and we cease to imagine a condition of perfect ease as possible for us. Desire is chastened into submission, and we are contented with our day when we have been able to bear our grief in silence and act as if we were not suffering. For it is at such periods that the sense of our lives having visible and invisible relations, beyond any of which either our present or prospective self is the centre, grows like a muscle that we are obliged to lean on and exert. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  That was Adam\u2019s state of mind in this second autumn of his sorrow. His work, as you know, had always been part of his religion, and from very early days he saw clearly that good carpentry was God\u2019s will\u2014was that form of God\u2019s will that most immediately concerned him. But now there was no margin of dreams for him beyond this daylight reality, no holiday-time in the working-day world, no moment in the distance when duty would take off her iron glove and breast-plate and clasp him gently into rest. He conceived no picture of the future but one made up of hard-working days such as he lived through, with growing contentment and intensity of interest, every fresh week. Love, he thought, could never be anything to him but a living memory\u2014a limb lopped off, but not gone from consciousness. He did not know that the power of loving was all the while gaining new force within him; that the new sensibilities bought by a deep experience were so many new fibres by which it was possible, nay, necessary to him, that his nature should intertwine with another. Yet he was aware that common affection and friendship were more precious to him than they used to be\u2014that he clung more to his mother and Seth, and had an unspeakable satisfaction in the sight or imagination of any small addition to their happiness. The Poysers, too\u2014hardly three or four days passed but he felt the need of seeing them and interchanging words and looks of friendliness with them. He would have felt this, probably, even if Dinah had not been with them, but he had only said the simplest truth in telling Dinah that he put her above all other friends in the world. Could anything be more natural? For in the darkest moments of memory the thought of her always came as the first ray of returning comfort. The early days of gloom at the Hall Farm had been gradually turned into soft moonlight by her presence; and in the cottage, too, for she had come at every spare moment to soothe and cheer poor Lisbeth, who had been stricken with a fear that subdued even her querulousness at the sight of her darling Adam\u2019s grief-worn face. He had become used to watching her light quiet movements, her pretty loving ways to the children, when he went to the Hall Farm; to listen for her voice as for a recurrent music; to think everything she said and did was just right, and could not have been better. In spite of his wisdom, he could not find fault with her for her overindulgence of the children, who had managed to convert Dinah the preacher, before whom a circle of rough men had often trembled a little, into a convenient household slave\u2014though Dinah herself was rather ashamed of this weakness, and had some inward conflict as to her departure from the precepts of Solomon. Yes, there was one thing that might have been better; she might have loved Seth and consented to marry him. He felt a little vexed, for his brother\u2019s sake, and he could not help thinking regretfully how Dinah, as Seth\u2019s wife, would have made their home as happy as it could be for them all\u2014how she was the one being that would have soothed their mother\u2019s last days into peacefulness and rest. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful she doesn\u2019t love th\u2019 lad,\u201d Adam had said sometimes to himself, \u201cfor anybody \u2019ud think he was just cut out for her. But her heart\u2019s so taken up with other things. She\u2019s one o\u2019 those women that feel no drawing towards having a husband and children o\u2019 their own. She thinks she should be filled up with her own life then, and she\u2019s been used so to living in other folks\u2019s cares, she can\u2019t bear the thought of her heart being shut up from \u2019em. I see how it is, well enough. She\u2019s cut out o\u2019 different stuff from most women: I saw that long ago. She\u2019s never easy but when she\u2019s helping somebody, and marriage \u2019ud interfere with her ways\u2014that\u2019s true. I\u2019ve no right to be contriving and thinking it \u2019ud be better if she\u2019d have Seth, as if I was wiser than she is\u2014or than God either, for He made her what she is, and that\u2019s one o\u2019 the greatest blessings I\u2019ve ever had from His hands, and others besides me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  This self-reproof had recurred strongly to Adam\u2019s mind when he gathered from Dinah\u2019s face that he had wounded her by referring to his wish that she had accepted Seth, and so he had endeavoured to put into the strongest words his confidence in her decision as right\u2014his resignation even to her going away from them and ceasing to make part of their life otherwise than by living in their thoughts, if that separation were chosen by herself. He felt sure she knew quite well enough how much he cared to see her continually\u2014to talk to her with the silent consciousness of a mutual great remembrance. It was not possible she should hear anything but self-renouncing affection and respect in his assurance that he was contented for her to go away; and yet there remained an uneasy feeling in his mind that he had not said quite the right thing\u2014that, somehow, Dinah had not understood him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Dinah must have risen a little before the sun the next morning, for she was downstairs about five o\u2019clock. So was Seth, for, through Lisbeth\u2019s obstinate refusal to have any woman-helper in the house, he had learned to make himself, as Adam said, \u201cvery handy in the housework,\u201d that he might save his mother from too great weariness; on which ground I hope you will not think him unmanly, any more than you can have thought the gallant Colonel Bath unmanly when he made the gruel for his invalid sister. Adam, who had sat up late at his writing, was still asleep, and was not likely, Seth said, to be down till breakfast-time. Often as Dinah had visited Lisbeth during the last eighteen months, she had never slept in the cottage since that night after Thias\u2019s death, when, you remember, Lisbeth praised her deft movements and even gave a modified approval to her porridge. But in that long interval Dinah had made great advances in household cleverness, and this morning, since Seth was there to help, she was bent on bringing everything to a pitch of cleanliness and order that would have satisfied her Aunt Poyser. The cottage was far from that standard at present, for Lisbeth\u2019s rheumatism had forced her to give up her old habits of dilettante scouring and polishing. When the kitchen was to her mind, Dinah went into the new room, where Adam had been writing the night before, to see what sweeping and dusting were needed there. She opened the window and let in the fresh morning air, and the smell of the sweet-brier, and the bright low-slanting rays of the early sun, which made a glory about her pale face and pale auburn hair as she held the long brush, and swept, singing to herself in a very low tone\u2014like a sweet summer murmur that you have to listen for very closely\u2014one of Charles Wesley\u2019s hymns: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Eternal Beam of Light Divine,     Fountain of unexhausted love, In whom the Father\u2019s glories shine,     Through earth beneath and heaven above; "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Jesus! the weary wanderer\u2019s rest,     Give me thy easy yoke to bear; With steadfast patience arm my breast,     With spotless love and holy fear. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Speak to my warring passions, \u201cPeace!\u201d     Say to my trembling heart, \u201cBe still!\u201d Thy power my strength and fortress is,     For all things serve thy sovereign will. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  She laid by the brush and took up the duster; and if you had ever lived in Mrs. Poyser\u2019s household, you would know how the duster behaved in Dinah\u2019s hand\u2014how it went into every small corner, and on every ledge in and out of sight\u2014how it went again and again round every bar of the chairs, and every leg, and under and over everything that lay on the table, till it came to Adam\u2019s papers and rulers and the open desk near them. Dinah dusted up to the very edge of these and then hesitated, looking at them with a longing but timid eye. It was painful to see how much dust there was among them. As she was looking in this way, she heard Seth\u2019s step just outside the open door, towards which her back was turned, and said, raising her clear treble, \u201cSeth, is your brother wrathful when his papers are stirred?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, very, when they are not put back in the right places,\u201d said a deep strong voice, not Seth\u2019s. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It was as if Dinah had put her hands unawares on a vibrating chord. She was shaken with an intense thrill, and for the instant felt nothing else; then she knew her cheeks were glowing, and dared not look round, but stood still, distressed because she could not say good-morning in a friendly way. Adam, finding that she did not look round so as to see the smile on his face, was afraid she had thought him serious about his wrathfulness, and went up to her, so that she was obliged to look at him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat! You think I\u2019m a cross fellow at home, Dinah?\u201d he said, smilingly. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay,\u201d said Dinah, looking up with timid eyes, \u201cnot so. But you might be put about by finding things meddled with; and even the man Moses, the meekest of men, was wrathful sometimes.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCome, then,\u201d said Adam, looking at her affectionately, \u201cI\u2019ll help you move the things, and put \u2019em back again, and then they can\u2019t get wrong. You\u2019re getting to be your aunt\u2019s own niece, I see, for particularness.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  They began their little task together, but Dinah had not recovered herself sufficiently to think of any remark, and Adam looked at her uneasily. Dinah, he thought, had seemed to disapprove him somehow lately; she had not been so kind and open to him as she used to be. He wanted her to look at him, and be as pleased as he was himself with doing this bit of playful work. But Dinah did not look at him\u2014it was easy for her to avoid looking at the tall man\u2014and when at last there was no more dusting to be done and no further excuse for him to linger near her, he could bear it no longer, and said, in rather a pleading tone, \u201cDinah, you\u2019re not displeased with me for anything, are you? I\u2019ve not said or done anything to make you think ill of me?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The question surprised her, and relieved her by giving a new course to her feeling. She looked up at him now, quite earnestly, almost with the tears coming, and said, \u201cOh, no, Adam! how could you think so?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear you not to feel as much a friend to me as I do to you,\u201d said Adam. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know the value I set on the very thought of you, Dinah. That was what I meant yesterday, when I said I\u2019d be content for you to go, if you thought right. I meant, the thought of you was worth so much to me, I should feel I ought to be thankful, and not grumble, if you see right to go away. You know I do mind parting with you, Dinah?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, dear friend,\u201d said Dinah, trembling, but trying to speak calmly, \u201cI know you have a brother\u2019s heart towards me, and we shall often be with one another in spirit; but at this season I am in heaviness through manifold temptations. You must not mark me. I feel called to leave my kindred for a while; but it is a trial\u2014the flesh is weak.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam saw that it pained her to be obliged to answer. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI hurt you by talking about it, Dinah,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll say no more. Let\u2019s see if Seth\u2019s ready with breakfast now.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  That is a simple scene, reader. But it is almost certain that you, too, have been in love\u2014perhaps, even, more than once, though you may not choose to say so to all your feminine friends. If so, you will no more think the slight words, the timid looks, the tremulous touches, by which two human souls approach each other gradually, like two little quivering rain-streams, before they mingle into one\u2014you will no more think these things trivial than you will think the first-detected signs of coming spring trivial, though they be but a faint indescribable something in the air and in the song of the birds, and the tiniest perceptible budding on the hedge-row branches. Those slight words and looks and touches are part of the soul\u2019s language; and the finest language, I believe, is chiefly made up of unimposing words, such as \u201clight,\u201d \u201csound,\u201d \u201cstars,\u201d \u201cmusic\u201d\u2014words really not worth looking at, or hearing, in themselves, any more than \u201cchips\u201d or \u201csawdust.\u201d It is only that they happen to be the signs of something unspeakably great and beautiful. I am of opinion that love is a great and beautiful thing too, and if you agree with me, the smallest signs of it will not be chips and sawdust to you: they will rather be like those little words, \u201clight\u201d and \u201cmusic,\u201d stirring the long-winding fibres of your memory and enriching your present with your most precious past."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

You have seen enough, I trust, of the Rev. Amos Barton, to be convinced that he was more apt to fall into a blunder than into a sin--more apt to be deceived than to incur a necessity for being deceitful: and if you have a keen eye for physiognomy, you will have detected that the Countess Czerlaski loved herself far too well to get entangled in an unprofitable vice. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"How then, you will say, could this fine lady choose to quarter herself on the establishment of a poor curate, where the carpets were probably falling into holes, where the attendance was limited to a maid of all work, and where six children were running loose from eight o\u2019clock in the morning till eight o\u2019clock in the evening? Surely you must be misrepresenting the facts. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Heaven forbid! For not having a lofty imagination, as you perceive, and being unable to invent thrilling incidents for your amusement, my only merit must lie in the truth with which I represent to you the humble experience of an ordinary fellow-mortal. I wish to stir your sympathy with commonplace troubles--to win your tears for real sorrow: sorrow such as may live next door to you--such as walks neither in rags nor in velvet, but in very ordinary decent apparel. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Therefore, that you may dismiss your suspicions of my veracity, I will beg you to consider, that at the time the Countess Czerlaski left Camp Villa in dudgeon, she had only twenty pounds in her pocket, being about one-third of the income she possessed independently of her brother. You will then perceive that she was in the extremely inconvenient predicament of having quarrelled, not indeed with her bread and cheese, but certainly with her chicken and tart--a predicament all the more inconvenient to her, because the habit of idleness had quite unfitted her for earning those necessary superfluities, and because, with all her fascinations, she had not secured any enthusiastic friends whose houses were open to her, and who were dying to see her. Thus she had completely checkmated herself, unless she could resolve on one unpleasant move--namely, to humble herself to her brother, and recognize his wife. This seemed quite impossible to her as long as she entertained the hope that he would make the first advances; and in this flattering hope she remained month after month at Shepperton Vicarage, gracefully overlooking the deficiencies of accommodation, and feeling that she was really behaving charmingly. \u2018Who indeed,\u2019 she thought to herself, \u2018could do otherwise, with a lovely, gentle creature like Milly? I shall really be sorry to leave the poor thing.\u2019 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"So, though she lay in bed till ten, and came down to a separate breakfast at eleven, she kindly consented to dine as early as five, when a hot joint was prepared, which coldly furnished forth the children\u2019s table the next day; she considerately prevented Milly from devoting herself too closely to the children, by insisting on reading, talking, and walking with her; and she even began to embroider a cap for the next baby, which must certainly be a girl, and be named Caroline. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"After the first month or two of her residence at the Vicarage, the Rev. Amos Barton became aware--as, indeed, it was unavoidable that he should--of the strong disapprobation it drew upon him, and the change of feeling towards him which it was producing in his kindest parishioners. But, in the first place, he still believed in the Countess as a charming and influential woman, disposed to befriend him, and, in any case, he could hardly hint departure to a lady guest who had been kind to him and his, and who might any day spontaneously announce the termination of her visit; in the second place, he was conscious of his own innocence, and felt some contemptuous indignation towards people who were ready to imagine evil of him; and, lastly, he had, as I have already intimated, a strong will of his own, so that a certain obstinacy and defiance mingled itself with his other feelings on the subject. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"The one unpleasant consequence which was not to be evaded or counteracted by any mere mental state, was the increasing drain on his slender purse for household expenses, to meet which the remittance he had received from the clerical charity threatened to be quite inadequate. Slander may be defeated by equanimity; but courageous thoughts will not pay your baker\u2019s bill, and fortitude is nowhere considered legal tender for beef. Month after month the financial aspect of the Rev. Amos\u2019s affairs became more and more serious to him, and month after month, too, wore away more and more of that armour of indignation and defiance with which he had at first defended himself from the harsh looks of faces that were once the friendliest. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"But quite the heaviest pressure of the trouble fell on Milly--on gentle, uncomplaining Milly--whose delicate body was becoming daily less fit for all the many things that had to be done between rising up and lying down. At first, she thought the Countess\u2019s visit would not last long, and she was quite glad to incur extra exertion for the sake of making her friend comfortable. I can hardly bear to think of all the rough work she did with those lovely hands--all by the sly, without letting her husband know anything about it, and husbands are not clairvoyant: how she salted bacon, ironed shirts and cravats, put patches on patches, and re-darned darns. Then there was the task of mending and eking out baby-linen in prospect, and the problem perpetually suggesting itself how she and Nanny should manage when there was another baby, as there would be before very many months were past. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"When time glided on, and the Countess\u2019s visit did not end, Milly was not blind to any phase of their position. She knew of the slander; she was aware of the keeping aloof of old friends; but these she felt almost entirely on her husband\u2019s account. A loving woman\u2019s world lies within the four walls of her own home; and it is only through her husband that she is in any electric communication with the world beyond. Mrs. Simpkins may have looked scornfully at her, but baby crows and holds out his little arms none the less blithely; Mrs. Tomkins may have left off calling on her, but her husband comes home none the less to receive her care and caresses; it has been wet and gloomy out of doors to-day, but she has looked well after the shirt buttons, has cut out baby\u2019s pinafores, and half finished Willy\u2019s blouse. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"So it was with Milly. She was only vexed that her husband should be vexed--only wounded because he was misconceived. But the difficulty about ways and means she felt in quite a different manner. Her rectitude was alarmed lest they should have to make tradesmen wait for their money; her motherly love dreaded the diminution of comforts for the children; and the sense of her own failing health gave exaggerated force to these fears. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Milly could no longer shut her eyes to the fact, that the Countess was inconsiderate, if she did not allow herself to entertain severer thoughts; and she began to feel that it would soon be a duty to tell her frankly that they really could not afford to have her visit farther prolonged. But a process was going forward in two other minds, which ultimately saved Milly from having to perform this painful task. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"In the first place, the Countess was getting weary of Shepperton--weary of waiting for her brother\u2019s overtures which never came; so, one fine morning, she reflected that forgiveness was a Christian duty, that a sister should be placable, that Mr. Bridmain must feel the need of her advice, to which he had been accustomed for three years, and that very likely \u2018that woman\u2019 didn\u2019t make the poor man happy. In this amiable frame of mind she wrote a very affectionate appeal, and addressed it to Mr. Bridmain, through his banker. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Another mind that was being wrought up to a climax was Nanny\u2019s, the maid-of-all-work, who had a warm heart and a still warmer temper. Nanny adored her mistress: she had been heard to say, that she was \u2018ready to kiss the ground as the missis trod on\u2019; and Walter, she considered, was ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her")," baby, of whom she was as jealous as a lover. But she had, from the first, very slight admiration for the Countess Czerlaski. That lady, from Nanny\u2019s point of view, was a personage always \u2018drawed out i\u2019 fine clothes\u2019, the chief result of whose existence was to cause additional bed-making, carrying of hot water, laying of table-cloths, and cooking of dinners. It was a perpetually heightening \u2018aggravation\u2019 to Nanny that she and her mistress had to \u2018slave\u2019 more than ever, because there was this fine lady in the house. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u2018An\u2019 she pays nothin\u2019 for\u2019t neither,\u2019 observed Nanny to Mr. Jacob Tomms, a young gentleman in the tailoring line, who occasionally--simply out of a taste for dialogue--looked into the vicarage kitchen of an evening. \u2018I know the master\u2019s shorter o\u2019 money than iver, an\u2019 it meks no end o\u2019 difference i\u2019 th\u2019 housekeepin\u2019--her bein\u2019 here, besides bein\u2019 obliged to have a charwoman constant.\u2019 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u2018There\u2019s fine stories i\u2019 the village about her,\u2019 said Mr. Tomms. \u2018They say as Muster Barton\u2019s great wi\u2019 her, or else she\u2019d niver stop here.\u2019 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u2018Then they say a passill o\u2019 lies, an\u2019 you ought to be ashamed to go an\u2019 tell \u2019em o\u2019er again.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"That spark happened to fall the very morning that Mrs. Hackit paid the visit to Mrs. Patten, recorded in the last chapter. Nanny\u2019s dislike of the Countess extended to the innocent dog Jet, whom she \u2018couldn\u2019t a-bear to see made a fuss wi\u2019 like a Christian.

These circumstances were already enough to make Nanny anxious and susceptible. But the Countess, comfortably ignorant of them, came down as usual about eleven o\u2019clock to her separate breakfast, which stood ready for her at that hour in the parlour; the kettle singing on the hob that she might make her own tea. There was a little jug of cream, taken according to custom from last night\u2019s milk, and specially saved for the Countess\u2019s breakfast. Jet always awaited his mistress at her bedroom door, and it was her habit to carry him down-stairs.

Nanny appeared, looking very red and heated--the fact was, she had been \u2018doing up\u2019 the kitchen fire, and that is a sort of work which by no means conduces to blandness of temper. \u2018Nanny, you have forgotten Jet\u2019s milk; will you bring me some more cream, please?\u2019 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"This was just a little too much for Nanny\u2019s forbearance. \u2018Yes, I dare say.

The interpretation too of Nanny\u2019s allusion to a \u2018bad name\u2019 did not lie out of the reach of the Countess\u2019s imagination, and she saw the necessity of quitting Shepperton without delay. Still, she would like to wait for her brother\u2019s letter--no--she would ask Milly to forward it to her--still better, she would go at once to London, inquire her brother\u2019s address at his banker\u2019s, and go to see him without preliminary.

He retained more of his original feeling for the Countess than Milly did, for women never betray themselves to men as they do to each other; and the Rev. Amos had not a keen instinct for character. But he felt that he was being relieved from a difficulty, and in the way that was easiest for him. Neither he nor Milly suspected that it was Nanny who had cut the knot for them, for the Countess took care to give no sign on that subject. As for Nanny, she was perfectly aware of the relation between cause and effect in the affair, and secretly chuckled over her outburst of \u2018sauce\u2019 as the best morning\u2019s work she had ever done.

After a last shake of the hand to Mr. Barton, and last kisses to Milly and the children, the door was closed; and as the fly rolled off, the little party at the Vicarage gate caught a last glimpse of the handsome Countess leaning and waving kisses from the carriage window. Jet\u2019s little black phiz was also seen, and doubtless he had his thoughts and feelings on the occasion, but he kept them strictly within his own bosom.

Nanny poured the joyful tidings into the ear of Mr. Farquhar\u2019s footman, who happened to call with a letter, and Mr. Brand carried them to all the patients he visited that morning, after calling on Mrs. Barton. So that, before Sunday, it was very generally known in Shepperton parish that the Countess Czerlaski had left the Vicarage. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"The Countess had left, but alas, the bills she had contributed to swell still remained; so did the exiguity of the children\u2019s clothing, which also was partly an indirect consequence of her presence; and so, too, did the coolness and alienation in the parishioners, which could not at once vanish before the fact of her departure. The Rev. Amos was not exculpated--the past was not expunged. But what was worse than all, Milly\u2019s health gave frequent cause for alarm, and the prospect of baby\u2019s birth was overshadowed by more than the usual fears. The birth came prematurely, about six weeks after the Countess\u2019s departure, but Mr. Brand gave favourable reports to all inquirers on the following day, which was Saturday. On Sunday, after morning service, Mrs. Hackit called at the Vicarage to inquire how Mrs. Barton was, and was invited up-stairs to see her. Milly lay placid and lovely in her feebleness, and held out her hand to Mrs. Hackit with a beaming smile. It was very pleasant to her to see her old friend unreserved and cordial once more. The seven months\u2019 baby was very tiny and very red, but \u2018handsome is that handsome does\u2019--he was pronounced to be \u2018doing well\u2019, and Mrs. Hackit went home gladdened at heart to think that the perilous hour was over."))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

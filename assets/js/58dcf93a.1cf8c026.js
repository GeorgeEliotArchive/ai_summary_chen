"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  She was standing on the causeway with her aunt and a group of cousins feeding the chickens, at that quiet moment in the life of the farmyards before the afternoon milking-time. The great buildings round the hollow yard were as dreary and tumbledown as ever, but over the old garden-wall the straggling rose-bushes were beginning to toss their summer weight, and the gray wood and old bricks of the house, on its higher level, had a look of sleepy age in the broad afternoon sunlight, that suited the quiescent time. Maggie, with her bonnet over her arm, was smiling down at the hatch of small fluffy chickens, when her aunt exclaimed,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGoodness me! who is that gentleman coming in at the gate?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It was a gentleman on a tall bay horse; and the flanks and neck of the horse were streaked black with fast riding.

He spoke almost abruptly, as if his errand were too pressing for him to trouble himself about what would be thought by Mrs Moss of his visit and request. Good Mrs Moss, rather nervous in the presence of this apparently haughty gentleman, was inwardly wondering whether she would be doing right or wrong to invite him again to leave his horse and walk in, when Maggie, feeling all the embarrassment of the situation, and unable to say anything, put on her bonnet, and turned to walk toward the gate. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Stephen turned too, and walked by her side, leading his horse. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Not a word was spoken till they were out in the lane, and had walked four or five yards, when Maggie, who had been looking straight before her all the while, turned again to walk back, saying, with haughty resentment,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere is no need for me to go any farther.

And when, if I had my own choice, I should ask you to take my hand and my fortune and my whole life, and do what you liked with them! I know I forgot myself. I took an unwarrantable liberty. I hate myself for having done it. But I repented immediately; I\u2019ve been repenting ever since. You ought not to think it unpardonable; a man who loves with his whole soul, as I do you, is liable to be mastered by his feelings for a moment; but you know\u2014you must believe\u2014that the worst pain I could have is to have pained you; that I would give the world to recall the error.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie dared not speak, dared not turn her head.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou must not say these things; I must not hear them,\u201d she said, looking down in misery, as Stephen came in front of her, to prevent her from going farther toward the gate. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for any pain you have to go through; but it is of no use to speak.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, it ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"is")," of use,\u201d said Stephen, impetuously. \u201cIt would be of use if you would treat me with some sort of pity and consideration, instead of doing me vile injustice in your mind. I could bear everything more quietly if I knew you didn\u2019t hate me for an insolent coxcomb.

But if you will go with me only a little way I can live on that. You see plainly enough that your anger has only made me ten times more unreasonable.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie turned. But Tancred, the bay horse, began to make such spirited remonstrances against this frequent change of direction, that Stephen, catching sight of Willy Moss peeping through the gate, called out, \u201cHere! just come and hold my horse for five minutes.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Maggie, hurriedly, \u201cmy aunt will think it so strange.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNever mind,\u201d Stephen answered impatiently; \u201cthey don\u2019t know the people at St Ogg\u2019s.

Then he burst out impetuously,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt is unnatural, it is horrible. Maggie, if you loved me as I love you, we should throw everything else to the winds for the sake of belonging to each other.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIf you do love me, dearest,\u201d said Stephen, gently, taking her hand again and laying it within his arm, \u201cit is better\u2014it is right that we should marry each other. We can\u2019t help the pain it will give. It is come upon us without our seeking; it is natural; it has taken hold of me in spite of every effort I have made to resist it. God knows, I\u2019ve been trying to be faithful to tacit engagements, and I\u2019ve only made things worse; I\u2019d better have given way at first.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie was silent. If it were ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"not")," wrong\u2014if she were once convinced of that, and need no longer beat and struggle against this current, soft and yet strong as the summer stream! "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSay \u2018yes,\u2019 dearest,\u201d said Stephen, leaning to look entreatingly in her face. \u201cWhat could we care about in the whole world beside, if we belonged to each other?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Her breath was on his face, his lips were very near hers, but there was a great dread dwelling in his love for her. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Her lips and eyelids quivered; she opened her eyes full on his for an instant, like a lovely wild animal timid and struggling under caresses, and then turned sharp round toward home again. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd after all,\u201d he went on, in an impatient tone, trying to defeat his own scruples as well as hers, \u201cI am breaking no positive engagement; if Lucy\u2019s affections had been withdrawn from me and given to some one else, I should have felt no right to assert a claim on her. If you are not absolutely pledged to Philip, we are neither of us bound.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou don\u2019t believe that; it is not your real feeling,\u201d said Maggie, earnestly. \u201cYou feel, as I do, that the real tie lies in the feelings and expectations we have raised in other minds. Else all pledges might be broken, when there was no outward penalty. There would be no such thing as faithfulness.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Stephen was silent; he could not pursue that argument; the opposite conviction had wrought in him too strongly through his previous time of struggle. But it soon presented itself in a new form. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThe pledge ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"can\u2019t")," be fulfilled,\u201d he said, with impetuous insistence. \u201cIt is unnatural; we can only pretend to give ourselves to any one else. There is wrong in that too; there may be misery in it for ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"them")," as well as for us. Maggie, you must see that; you do see that.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He was looking eagerly at her face for the least sign of compliance; his large, firm, gentle grasp was on her hand. She was silent for a few moments, with her eyes fixed on the ground; then she drew a deep breath, and said, looking up at him with solemn sadness,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, it is difficult,\u2014life is very difficult! It seems right to me sometimes that we should follow our strongest feeling; but then, such feelings continually come across the ties that all our former life has made for us,\u2014the ties that have made others dependent on us,\u2014and would cut them in two. If life were quite easy and simple, as it might have been in Paradise, and we could always see that one being first toward whom\u2014I mean, if life did not make duties for us before love comes, love would be a sign that two people ought to belong to each other. But I see\u2014I feel it is not so now; there are things we must renounce in life; some of us must resign love. Many things are difficult and dark to me; but I see one thing quite clearly,\u2014that I must not, cannot, seek my own happiness by sacrificing others. Love is natural; but surely pity and faithfulness and memory are natural too. And they would live in me still, and punish me if I did not obey them. I should be haunted by the suffering I had caused. Our love would be poisoned.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDearest,\u201d he said, in scarcely more than a whisper, while his arm stole round her, \u201cI\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll bear anything you wish.

Stephen stood still and beckoned when they came within sight of Willy and the horse, and Maggie went on through the gate. Mrs Moss was standing alone at the door of the old porch; she had sent all the cousins in, with kind thoughtfulness. It might be a joyful thing that Maggie had a rich and handsome lover, but she would naturally feel embarrassed at coming in again; and it might ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"not")," be joyful. In either case Mrs Moss waited anxiously to receive Maggie by herself. The speaking face told plainly enough that, if there was joy, it was of a very agitating, dubious sort.

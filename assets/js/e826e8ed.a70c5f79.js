The scene was the Grove by Donnithorne Chase: you know who the men were. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The old squire\u2019s funeral had taken place that morning, the will had been read, and now in the first breathing-space, Arthur Donnithorne had come out for a lonely walk, that he might look fixedly at the new future before him and confirm himself in a sad resolution. He thought he could do that best in the Grove. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam too had come from Stoniton on Monday evening, and to-day he had not left home, except to go to the family at the Hall Farm and tell them everything that Mr. Irwine had left untold. He had agreed with the Poysers that he would follow them to their new neighbourhood, wherever that might be, for he meant to give up the management of the woods, and, as soon as it was practicable, he would wind up his business with Jonathan Burge and settle with his mother and Seth in a home within reach of the friends to whom he felt bound by a mutual sorrow. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSeth and me are sure to find work,\u201d he said. \u201cA man that\u2019s got our trade at his finger-ends is at home everywhere; and we must make a new start. My mother won\u2019t stand in the way, for she\u2019s told me, since I came home, she\u2019d made up her mind to being buried in another parish, if I wished it, and if I\u2019d be more comfortable elsewhere. It\u2019s wonderful how quiet she\u2019s been ever since I came back. It seems as if the very greatness o\u2019 the trouble had quieted and calmed her. We shall all be better in a new country, though there\u2019s some I shall be loath to leave behind. But I won\u2019t part from you and yours, if I can help it, Mr. Poyser. Trouble\u2019s made us kin.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAye, lad,\u201d said Martin. \u201cWe\u2019ll go out o\u2019 hearing o\u2019 that man\u2019s name. But I doubt we shall ne\u2019er go far enough for folks not to find out as we\u2019ve got them belonging to us as are transported o\u2019er the seas, and were like to be hanged. We shall have that flyin\u2019 up in our faces, and our children\u2019s after us.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  That was a long visit to the Hall Farm, and drew too strongly on Adam\u2019s energies for him to think of seeing others, or re-entering on his old occupations till the morrow. \u201cBut to-morrow,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cI\u2019ll go to work again. I shall learn to like it again some time, maybe; and it\u2019s right whether I like it or not.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  This evening was the last he would allow to be absorbed by sorrow: suspense was gone now, and he must bear the unalterable. He was resolved not to see Arthur Donnithorne again, if it were possible to avoid him. He had no message to deliver from Hetty now, for Hetty had seen Arthur. And Adam distrusted himself\u2014he had learned to dread the violence of his own feeling. That word of Mr. Irwine\u2019s\u2014that he must remember what he had felt after giving the last blow to Arthur in the Grove\u2014had remained with him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  These thoughts about Arthur, like all thoughts that are charged with strong feeling, were continually recurring, and they always called up the image of the Grove\u2014of that spot under the overarching boughs where he had caught sight of the two bending figures, and had been possessed by sudden rage. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ll go and see it again to-night for the last time,\u201d he said; \u201cit\u2019ll do me good; it\u2019ll make me feel over again what I felt when I\u2019d knocked him down. I felt what poor empty work it was, as soon as I\u2019d done it, ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"before")," I began to think he might be dead.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  In this way it happened that Arthur and Adam were walking towards the same spot at the same time. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam had on his working-dress again, now, for he had thrown off the other with a sense of relief as soon as he came home; and if he had had the basket of tools over his shoulder, he might have been taken, with his pale wasted face, for the spectre of the Adam Bede who entered the Grove on that August evening eight months ago. But he had no basket of tools, and he was not walking with the old erectness, looking keenly round him; his hands were thrust in his side pockets, and his eyes rested chiefly on the ground. He had not long entered the Grove, and now he paused before a beech. He knew that tree well; it was the boundary mark of his youth\u2014the sign, to him, of the time when some of his earliest, strongest feelings had left him. He felt sure they would never return. And yet, at this moment, there was a stirring of affection at the remembrance of that Arthur Donnithorne whom he had believed in before he had come up to this beech eight months ago. It was affection for the dead: ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"that")," Arthur existed no longer. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He was disturbed by the sound of approaching footsteps, but the beech stood at a turning in the road, and he could not see who was coming until the tall slim figure in deep mourning suddenly stood before him at only two yards\u2019 distance. They both started, and looked at each other in silence. Often, in the last fortnight, Adam had imagined himself as close to Arthur as this, assailing him with words that should be as harrowing as the voice of remorse, forcing upon him a just share in the misery he had caused; and often, too, he had told himself that such a meeting had better not be. But in imagining the meeting he had always seen Arthur, as he had met him on that evening in the Grove, florid, careless, light of speech; and the figure before him touched him with the signs of suffering. Adam knew what suffering was\u2014he could not lay a cruel finger on a bruised man. He felt no impulse that he needed to resist. Silence was more just than reproach. Arthur was the first to speak. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAdam,\u201d he said, quietly, \u201cit may be a good thing that we have met here, for I wished to see you. I should have asked to see you to-morrow.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He paused, but Adam said nothing. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI know it is painful to you to meet me,\u201d Arthur went on, \u201cbut it is not likely to happen again for years to come.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said Adam, coldly, \u201cthat was what I meant to write to you to-morrow, as it would be better all dealings should be at an end between us, and somebody else put in my place.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur felt the answer keenly, and it was not without an effort that he spoke again. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt was partly on that subject I wished to speak to you. I don\u2019t want to lessen your indignation against me, or ask you to do anything for my sake. I only wish to ask you if you will help me to lessen the evil consequences of the past, which is unchangeable. I don\u2019t mean consequences to myself, but to others. It is but little I can do, I know. I know the worst consequences will remain; but something may be done, and you can help me. Will you listen to me patiently?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Adam, after some hesitation; \u201cI\u2019ll hear what it is. If I can help to mend anything, I will. Anger \u2019ull mend nothing, I know. We\u2019ve had enough o\u2019 that.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI was going to the Hermitage,\u201d said Arthur. \u201cWill you go there with me and sit down? We can talk better there.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The Hermitage had never been entered since they left it together, for Arthur had locked up the key in his desk. And now, when he opened the door, there was the candle burnt out in the socket; there was the chair in the same place where Adam remembered sitting; there was the waste-paper basket full of scraps, and deep down in it, Arthur felt in an instant, there was the little pink silk handkerchief. It would have been painful to enter this place if their previous thoughts had been less painful. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  They sat down opposite each other in the old places, and Arthur said, \u201cI\u2019m going away, Adam; I\u2019m going into the army.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Poor Arthur felt that Adam ought to be affected by this announcement\u2014ought to have a movement of sympathy towards him. But Adam\u2019s lips remained firmly closed, and the expression of his face unchanged. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat I want to say to you,\u201d Arthur continued, \u201cis this: one of my reasons for going away is that no one else may leave Hayslope\u2014may leave their home on my account. I would do anything, there is no sacrifice I would not make, to prevent any further injury to others through my\u2014through what has happened.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur\u2019s words had precisely the opposite effect to that he had anticipated. Adam thought he perceived in them that notion of compensation for irretrievable wrong, that self-soothing attempt to make evil bear the same fruits as good, which most of all roused his indignation. He was as strongly impelled to look painful facts right in the face as Arthur was to turn away his eyes from them. Moreover, he had the wakeful suspicious pride of a poor man in the presence of a rich man. He felt his old severity returning as he said, \u201cThe time\u2019s past for that, sir. A man should make sacrifices to keep clear of doing a wrong; sacrifices won\u2019t undo it when it\u2019s done. When people\u2019s feelings have got a deadly wound, they can\u2019t be cured with favours.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cFavours!\u201d said Arthur, passionately; \u201cno; how can you suppose I meant that? But the Poysers\u2014Mr. Irwine tells me the Poysers mean to leave the place where they have lived so many years\u2014for generations. Don\u2019t you see, as Mr. Irwine does, that if they could be persuaded to overcome the feeling that drives them away, it would be much better for them in the end to remain on the old spot, among the friends and neighbours who know them?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Adam coldly. \u201cBut then, sir, folks\u2019s feelings are not so easily overcome. It\u2019ll be hard for Martin Poyser to go to a strange place, among strange faces, when he\u2019s been bred up on the Hall Farm, and his father before him; but then it \u2019ud be harder for a man with his feelings to stay. I don\u2019t see how the thing\u2019s to be made any other than hard. There\u2019s a sort o\u2019 damage, sir, that can\u2019t be made up for.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur was silent some moments. In spite of other feelings dominant in him this evening, his pride winced under Adam\u2019s mode of treating him. Wasn\u2019t he himself suffering? Was not he too obliged to renounce his most cherished hopes? It was now as it had been eight months ago\u2014Adam was forcing Arthur to feel more intensely the irrevocableness of his own wrong-doing. He was presenting the sort of resistance that was the most irritating to Arthur\u2019s eager ardent nature. But his anger was subdued by the same influence that had subdued Adam\u2019s when they first confronted each other\u2014by the marks of suffering in a long familiar face. The momentary struggle ended in the feeling that he could bear a great deal from Adam, to whom he had been the occasion of bearing so much; but there was a touch of pleading, boyish vexation in his tone as he said, \u201cBut people may make injuries worse by unreasonable conduct\u2014by giving way to anger and satisfying that for the moment, instead of thinking what will be the effect in the future. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIf I were going to stay here and act as landlord,\u201d he added presently, with still more eagerness\u2014\u201cif I were careless about what I\u2019ve done\u2014what I\u2019ve been the cause of, you would have some excuse, Adam, for going away and encouraging others to go. You would have some excuse then for trying to make the evil worse. But when I tell you I\u2019m going away for years\u2014when you know what that means for me, how it cuts off every plan of happiness I\u2019ve ever formed\u2014it is impossible for a sensible man like you to believe that there is any real ground for the Poysers refusing to remain. I know their feeling about disgrace\u2014Mr. Irwine has told me all; but he is of opinion that they might be persuaded out of this idea that they are disgraced in the eyes of their neighbours, and that they can\u2019t remain on my estate, if you would join him in his efforts\u2014if you would stay yourself and go on managing the old woods.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur paused a moment and then added, pleadingly, \u201cYou know that\u2019s a good work to do for the sake of other people, besides the owner. And you don\u2019t know but that they may have a better owner soon, whom you will like to work for. If I die, my cousin Tradgett will have the estate and take my name. He is a good fellow.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam could not help being moved: it was impossible for him not to feel that this was the voice of the honest warm-hearted Arthur whom he had loved and been proud of in old days; but nearer memories would not be thrust away. He was silent; yet Arthur saw an answer in his face that induced him to go on, with growing earnestness. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd then, if you would talk to the Poysers\u2014if you would talk the matter over with Mr. Irwine\u2014he means to see you to-morrow\u2014and then if you would join your arguments to his to prevail on them not to go.... I know, of course, that they would not accept any favour from me\u2014I mean nothing of that kind\u2014but I\u2019m sure they would suffer less in the end. Irwine thinks so too. And Mr. Irwine is to have the chief authority on the estate\u2014he has consented to undertake that. They will really be under no man but one whom they respect and like. It would be the same with you, Adam, and it could be nothing but a desire to give me worse pain that could incline you to go.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur was silent again for a little while, and then said, with some agitation in his voice, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t act so towards you, I know. If you were in my place and I in yours, I should try to help you to do the best.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam made a hasty movement on his chair and looked on the ground. Arthur went on, \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve never done anything you\u2019ve had bitterly to repent of in your life, Adam; if you had, you would be more generous. You would know then that it\u2019s worse for me than for you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur rose from his seat with the last words, and went to one of the windows, looking out and turning his back on Adam, as he continued, passionately, "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHaven\u2019t ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I")," loved her too? Didn\u2019t I see her yesterday? Shan\u2019t I carry the thought of her about with me as much as you will? And don\u2019t you think you would suffer more if you\u2019d been in fault?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There was silence for several minutes, for the struggle in Adam\u2019s mind was not easily decided. Facile natures, whose emotions have little permanence, can hardly understand how much inward resistance he overcame before he rose from his seat and turned towards Arthur. Arthur heard the movement, and turning round, met the sad but softened look with which Adam said, "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s true what you say, sir. I\u2019m hard\u2014it\u2019s in my nature. I was too hard with my father, for doing wrong. I\u2019ve been a bit hard t\u2019 everybody but ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her"),". I felt as if nobody pitied her enough\u2014her suffering cut into me so; and when I thought the folks at the farm were too hard with her, I said I\u2019d never be hard to anybody myself again. But feeling overmuch about her has perhaps made me unfair to you. I\u2019ve known what it is in my life to repent and feel it\u2019s too late. I felt I\u2019d been too harsh to my father when he was gone from me\u2014I feel it now, when I think of him. I\u2019ve no right to be hard towards them as have done wrong and repent.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam spoke these words with the firm distinctness of a man who is resolved to leave nothing unsaid that he is bound to say; but he went on with more hesitation. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t shake hands with you once, sir, when you asked me\u2014but if you\u2019re willing to do it now, for all I refused then...\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur\u2019s white hand was in Adam\u2019s large grasp in an instant, and with that action there was a strong rush, on both sides, of the old, boyish affection. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAdam,\u201d Arthur said, impelled to full confession now, \u201cit would never have happened if I\u2019d known you loved her. That would have helped to save me from it. And I ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"did")," struggle: I never meant to injure her. I deceived you afterwards\u2014and that led on to worse; but I thought it was forced upon me, I thought it was the best thing I could do. And in that letter I told her to let me know if she were in any trouble: don\u2019t think I would not have done everything I could. But I was all wrong from the very first, and horrible wrong has come of it. God knows, I\u2019d give my life if I could undo it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  They sat down again opposite each other, and Adam said, tremulously, \u201cHow did she seem when you left her, sir?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t ask me, Adam,\u201d Arthur said; \u201cI feel sometimes as if I should go mad with thinking of her looks and what she said to me, and then, that I couldn\u2019t get a full pardon\u2014that I couldn\u2019t save her from that wretched fate of being transported\u2014that I can do nothing for her all those years; and she may die under it, and never know comfort any more.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, sir,\u201d said Adam, for the first time feeling his own pain merged in sympathy for Arthur, \u201cyou and me\u2019ll often be thinking o\u2019 the same thing, when we\u2019re a long way off one another. I\u2019ll pray God to help you, as I pray him to help me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut there\u2019s that sweet woman\u2014that Dinah Morris,\u201d Arthur said, pursuing his own thoughts and not knowing what had been the sense of Adam\u2019s words, \u201cshe says she shall stay with her to the very last moment\u2014till she goes; and the poor thing clings to her as if she found some comfort in her. I could worship that woman; I don\u2019t know what I should do if she were not there. Adam, you will see her when she comes back. I could say nothing to her yesterday\u2014nothing of what I felt towards her. Tell her,\u201d Arthur went on hurriedly, as if he wanted to hide the emotion with which he spoke, while he took off his chain and watch, \u201ctell her I asked you to give her this in remembrance of me\u2014of the man to whom she is the one source of comfort, when he thinks of... I know she doesn\u2019t care about such things\u2014or anything else I can give her for its own sake.

You see, it\u2019s the same with both me and the Poysers: if we stay, it\u2019s for our own worldly interest, and it looks as if we\u2019d put up with anything for the sake o\u2019 that. I know that\u2019s what they\u2019ll feel, and I can\u2019t help feeling a little of it myself.

That is not a reason strong enough against a course that is really more generous, more unselfish than the other.

Adam, don\u2019t try to make things worse for me; I\u2019m punished enough without that.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, sir, no,\u201d Adam said, looking at Arthur with mournful affection. \u201cGod forbid I should make things worse for you.

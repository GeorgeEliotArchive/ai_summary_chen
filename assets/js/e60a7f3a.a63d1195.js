There was no agitation visible in her, but a deep concentrated calmness, as if, even when she was speaking, her soul was in prayer reposing on an unseen support. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  After speaking to the jailer, the magistrate turned to her and said, \u201cThe turnkey will take you to the prisoner\u2019s cell and leave you there for the night, if you desire it, but you can\u2019t have a light during the night\u2014it is contrary to rules. My name is Colonel Townley: if I can help you in anything, ask the jailer for my address and come to me. I take some interest in this Hetty Sorrel, for the sake of that fine fellow, Adam Bede.

I am grateful to you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  As Dinah crossed the prison court with the turnkey, the solemn evening light seemed to make the walls higher than they were by day, and the sweet pale face in the cap was more than ever like a white flower on this background of gloom. The turnkey looked askance at her all the while, but never spoke. He somehow felt that the sound of his own rude voice would be grating just then. He struck a light as they entered the dark corridor leading to the condemned cell, and then said in his most civil tone, \u201cIt\u2019ll be pretty nigh dark in the cell a\u2019ready, but I can stop with my light a bit, if you like.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, friend, thank you,\u201d said Dinah. \u201cI wish to go in alone.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAs you like,\u201d said the jailer, turning the harsh key in the lock and opening the door wide enough to admit Dinah. A jet of light from his lantern fell on the opposite corner of the cell, where Hetty was sitting on her straw pallet with her face buried in her knees. It seemed as if she were asleep, and yet the grating of the lock would have been likely to waken her. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The door closed again, and the only light in the cell was that of the evening sky, through the small high grating\u2014enough to discern human faces by. Dinah stood still for a minute, hesitating to speak because Hetty might be asleep, and looking at the motionless heap with a yearning heart. Then she said, softly, \u201cHetty!\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  There was a slight movement perceptible in Hetty\u2019s frame\u2014a start such as might have been produced by a feeble electrical shock\u2014but she did not look up. Dinah spoke again, in a tone made stronger by irrepressible emotion, \u201cHetty... it\u2019s Dinah.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Again there was a slight startled movement through Hetty\u2019s frame, and without uncovering her face, she raised her head a little, as if listening. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHetty... Dinah is come to you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  After a moment\u2019s pause, Hetty lifted her head slowly and timidly from her knees and raised her eyes. The two pale faces were looking at each other: one with a wild hard despair in it, the other full of sad yearning love. Dinah unconsciously opened her arms and stretched them out. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t you know me, Hetty? Don\u2019t you remember Dinah? Did you think I wouldn\u2019t come to you in trouble?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty kept her eyes fixed on Dinah\u2019s face\u2014at first like an animal that gazes, and gazes, and keeps aloof. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m come to be with you, Hetty\u2014not to leave you\u2014to stay with you\u2014to be your sister to the last.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Slowly, while Dinah was speaking, Hetty rose, took a step forward, and was clasped in Dinah\u2019s arms. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  They stood so a long while, for neither of them felt the impulse to move apart again. Hetty, without any distinct thought of it, hung on this something that was come to clasp her now, while she was sinking helpless in a dark gulf; and Dinah felt a deep joy in the first sign that her love was welcomed by the wretched lost one. The light got fainter as they stood, and when at last they sat down on the straw pallet together, their faces had become indistinct. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Not a word was spoken. Dinah waited, hoping for a spontaneous word from Hetty, but she sat in the same dull despair, only clutching the hand that held hers and leaning her cheek against Dinah\u2019s. It was the human contact she clung to, but she was not the less sinking into the dark gulf. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Dinah began to doubt whether Hetty was conscious who it was that sat beside her. She thought suffering and fear might have driven the poor sinner out of her mind. But it was borne in upon her, as she afterwards said, that she must not hurry God\u2019s work: we are overhasty to speak\u2014as if God did not manifest himself by our silent feeling, and make his love felt through ours. She did not know how long they sat in that way, but it got darker and darker, till there was only a pale patch of light on the opposite wall: all the rest was darkness. But she felt the Divine presence more and more\u2014nay, as if she herself were a part of it, and it was the Divine pity that was beating in her heart and was willing the rescue of this helpless one. At last she was prompted to speak and find out how far Hetty was conscious of the present. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHetty,\u201d she said gently, \u201cdo you know who it is that sits by your side?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d Hetty answered slowly, \u201cit\u2019s Dinah.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd do you remember the time when we were at the Hall Farm together, and that night when I told you to be sure and think of me as a friend in trouble?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Hetty. Then, after a pause, she added, \u201cBut you can do nothing for me. You can\u2019t make \u2019em do anything. They\u2019ll hang me o\u2019 Monday\u2014it\u2019s Friday now.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  As Hetty said the last words, she clung closer to Dinah, shuddering. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, Hetty, I can\u2019t save you from that death. But isn\u2019t the suffering less hard when you have somebody with you, that feels for you\u2014that you can speak to, and say what\u2019s in your heart?... Yes, Hetty: you lean on me: you are glad to have me with you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou won\u2019t leave me, Dinah?

But, Hetty, there is some one else in this cell besides me, some one close to you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty said, in a frightened whisper, \u201cWho?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSome one who has been with you through all your hours of sin and trouble\u2014who has known every thought you have had\u2014has seen where you went, where you lay down and rose up again, and all the deeds you have tried to hide in darkness.

If God our Father was your friend, and was willing to save you from sin and suffering, so as you should neither know wicked feelings nor pain again?

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBecause, Hetty, you are shutting up your soul against him, by trying to hide the truth. God\u2019s love and mercy can overcome all things\u2014our ignorance, and weakness, and all the burden of our past wickedness\u2014all things but our wilful sin, sin that we cling to, and will not give up. You believe in my love and pity for you, Hetty, but if you had not let me come near you, if you wouldn\u2019t have looked at me or spoken to me, you\u2019d have shut me out from helping you. I couldn\u2019t have made you feel my love; I couldn\u2019t have told you what I felt for you. Don\u2019t shut God\u2019s love out in that way, by clinging to sin.... He can\u2019t bless you while you have one falsehood in your soul; his pardoning mercy can\u2019t reach you until you open your heart to him, and say, \u2018I have done this great wickedness; O God, save me, make me pure from sin.\u2019 While you cling to one sin and will not part with it, it must drag you down to misery after death, as it has dragged you to misery here in this world, my poor, poor Hetty. It is sin that brings dread, and darkness, and despair: there is light and blessedness for us as soon as we cast it off. God enters our souls then, and teaches us, and brings us strength and peace. Cast it off now, Hetty\u2014now: confess the wickedness you have done\u2014the sin you have been guilty of against your Heavenly Father. Let us kneel down together, for we are in the presence of God.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty obeyed Dinah\u2019s movement, and sank on her knees. They still held each other\u2019s hands, and there was long silence. Then Dinah said, \u201cHetty, we are before God. He is waiting for you to tell the truth.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Still there was silence. At last Hetty spoke, in a tone of beseeching\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDinah... help me...

Dinah raised her gently from her knees and seated her on the pallet again, sitting down by her side. It was a long time before the convulsed throat was quiet, and even then they sat some time in stillness and darkness, holding each other\u2019s hands. At last Hetty whispered, \u201cI did do it, Dinah... I buried it in the wood... the little baby... and it cried... I heard it cry... ever such a way off... all night... and I went back because it cried.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  She paused, and then spoke hurriedly in a louder, pleading tone.

I didn\u2019t know where to go... and I tried to kill myself before, and I couldn\u2019t. Oh, I tried so to drown myself in the pool, and I couldn\u2019t. I went to Windsor\u2014I ran away\u2014did you know? I went to find him, as he might take care of me; and he was gone; and then I didn\u2019t know what to do. I daredn\u2019t go back home again\u2014I couldn\u2019t bear it. I couldn\u2019t have bore to look at anybody, for they\u2019d have scorned me. I thought o\u2019 you sometimes, and thought I\u2019d come to you, for I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be cross with me, and cry shame on me. I thought I could tell you. But then the other folks \u2019ud come to know it at last, and I couldn\u2019t bear that. It was partly thinking o\u2019 you made me come toward Stoniton; and, besides, I was so frightened at going wandering about till I was a beggar-woman, and had nothing; and sometimes it seemed as if I must go back to the farm sooner than that. Oh, it was so dreadful, Dinah... I was so miserable... I wished I\u2019d never been born into this world. I should never like to go into the green fields again\u2014I hated \u2019em so in my misery.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty paused again, as if the sense of the past were too strong upon her for words. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd then I got to Stoniton, and I began to feel frightened that night, because I was so near home. And then the little baby was born, when I didn\u2019t expect it; and the thought came into my mind that I might get rid of it and go home again. The thought came all of a sudden, as I was lying in the bed, and it got stronger and stronger... I longed so to go back again... I couldn\u2019t bear being so lonely and coming to beg for want. And it gave me strength and resolution to get up and dress myself. I felt I must do it... I didn\u2019t know how... I thought I\u2019d find a pool, if I could, like that other, in the corner of the field, in the dark. And when the woman went out, I felt as if I was strong enough to do anything... I thought I should get rid of all my misery, and go back home, and never let \u2019em know why I ran away. I put on my bonnet and shawl, and went out into the dark street, with the baby under my cloak; and I walked fast till I got into a street a good way off, and there was a public, and I got some warm stuff to drink and some bread. And I walked on and on, and I hardly felt the ground I trod on; and it got lighter, for there came the moon\u2014oh, Dinah, it frightened me when it first looked at me out o\u2019 the clouds\u2014it never looked so before; and I turned out of the road into the fields, for I was afraid o\u2019 meeting anybody with the moon shining on me. And I came to a haystack, where I thought I could lie down and keep myself warm all night. There was a place cut into it, where I could make me a bed, and I lay comfortable, and the baby was warm against me; and I must have gone to sleep for a good while, for when I woke it was morning, but not very light, and the baby was crying. And I saw a wood a little way off... I thought there\u2019d perhaps be a ditch or a pond there... and it was so early I thought I could hide the child there, and get a long way off before folks was up. And then I thought I\u2019d go home\u2014I\u2019d get rides in carts and go home and tell \u2019em I\u2019d been to try and see for a place, and couldn\u2019t get one. I longed so for it, Dinah, I longed so to be safe at home. I don\u2019t know how I felt about the baby. I seemed to hate it\u2014it was like a heavy weight hanging round my neck; and yet its crying went through me, and I daredn\u2019t look at its little hands and face. But I went on to the wood, and I walked about, but there was no water....\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty shuddered. She was silent for some moments, and when she began again, it was in a whisper. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI came to a place where there was lots of chips and turf, and I sat down on the trunk of a tree to think what I should do. And all of a sudden I saw a hole under the nut-tree, like a little grave. And it darted into me like lightning\u2014I\u2019d lay the baby there and cover it with the grass and the chips. I couldn\u2019t kill it any other way. And I\u2019d done it in a minute; and, oh, it cried so, Dinah\u2014I ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"couldn\u2019t")," cover it quite up\u2014I thought perhaps somebody \u2019ud come and take care of it, and then it wouldn\u2019t die. And I made haste out of the wood, but I could hear it crying all the while; and when I got out into the fields, it was as if I was held fast\u2014I couldn\u2019t go away, for all I wanted so to go. And I sat against the haystack to watch if anybody \u2019ud come. I was very hungry, and I\u2019d only a bit of bread left, but I couldn\u2019t go away. And after ever such a while\u2014hours and hours\u2014the man came\u2014him in a smock-frock, and he looked at me so, I was frightened, and I made haste and went on. I thought he was going to the wood and would perhaps find the baby. And I went right on, till I came to a village, a long way off from the wood, and I was very sick, and faint, and hungry. I got something to eat there, and bought a loaf. But I was frightened to stay. I heard the baby crying, and thought the other folks heard it too\u2014and I went on. But I was so tired, and it was getting towards dark. And at last, by the roadside there was a barn\u2014ever such a way off any house\u2014like the barn in Abbot\u2019s Close, and I thought I could go in there and hide myself among the hay and straw, and nobody \u2019ud be likely to come. I went in, and it was half full o\u2019 trusses of straw, and there was some hay too. And I made myself a bed, ever so far behind, where nobody could find me; and I was so tired and weak, I went to sleep.... But oh, the baby\u2019s crying kept waking me, and I thought that man as looked at me so was come and laying hold of me. But I must have slept a long while at last, though I didn\u2019t know, for when I got up and went out of the barn, I didn\u2019t know whether it was night or morning. But it was morning, for it kept getting lighter, and I turned back the way I\u2019d come. I couldn\u2019t help it, Dinah; it was the baby\u2019s crying made me go\u2014and yet I was frightened to death. I thought that man in the smock-frock \u2019ud see me and know I put the baby there. But I went on, for all that. I\u2019d left off thinking about going home\u2014it had gone out o\u2019 my mind. I saw nothing but that place in the wood where I\u2019d buried the baby... I see it now. Oh Dinah! shall I allays see it?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty clung round Dinah and shuddered again. The silence seemed long before she went on. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI met nobody, for it was very early, and I got into the wood.... I knew the way to the place... the place against the nut-tree; and I could hear it crying at every step.... I thought it was alive.... I don\u2019t know whether I was frightened or glad... I don\u2019t know what I felt. I only know I was in the wood and heard the cry. I don\u2019t know what I felt till I saw the baby was gone. And when I\u2019d put it there, I thought I should like somebody to find it and save it from dying; but when I saw it was gone, I was struck like a stone, with fear. I never thought o\u2019 stirring, I felt so weak. I knew I couldn\u2019t run away, and everybody as saw me \u2019ud know about the baby. My heart went like a stone. I couldn\u2019t wish or try for anything; it seemed like as if I should stay there for ever, and nothing \u2019ud ever change. But they came and took me away.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty was silent, but she shuddered again, as if there was still something behind; and Dinah waited, for her heart was so full that tears must come before words. At last Hetty burst out, with a sob, \u201cDinah, do you think God will take away that crying and the place in the wood, now I\u2019ve told everything?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet us pray, poor sinner.

The fear and haste together produced a state of strong excitement before he reached the rectory gate, and outside it he saw the deep marks of a recent hoof on the gravel. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  But the hoofs were turned towards the gate, not away from it, and though there was a horse against the stable door, it was not Mr. Irwine\u2019s: it had evidently had a journey this morning, and must belong to some one who had come on business. Mr. Irwine was at home, then; but Adam could hardly find breath and calmness to tell Carroll that he wanted to speak to the rector. The double suffering of certain and uncertain sorrow had begun to shake the strong man. The butler looked at him wonderingly, as he threw himself on a bench in the passage and stared absently at the clock on the opposite wall. The master had somebody with him, he said, but he heard the study door open\u2014the stranger seemed to be coming out, and as Adam was in a hurry, he would let the master know at once. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam sat looking at the clock: the minute-hand was hurrying along the last five minutes to ten with a loud, hard, indifferent tick, and Adam watched the movement and listened to the sound as if he had had some reason for doing so. In our times of bitter suffering there are almost always these pauses, when our consciousness is benumbed to everything but some trivial perception or sensation. It is as if semi-idiocy came to give us rest from the memory and the dread which refuse to leave us in our sleep. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Carroll, coming back, recalled Adam to the sense of his burden. He was to go into the study immediately. \u201cI can\u2019t think what that strange person\u2019s come about,\u201d the butler added, from mere incontinence of remark, as he preceded Adam to the door, \u201che\u2019s gone i\u2019 the dining-room. And master looks unaccountable\u2014as if he was frightened.\u201d Adam took no notice of the words: he could not care about other people\u2019s business. But when he entered the study and looked in Mr. Irwine\u2019s face, he felt in an instant that there was a new expression in it, strangely different from the warm friendliness it had always worn for him before. A letter lay open on the table, and Mr. Irwine\u2019s hand was on it, but the changed glance he cast on Adam could not be owing entirely to preoccupation with some disagreeable business, for he was looking eagerly towards the door, as if Adam\u2019s entrance were a matter of poignant anxiety to him.

But when Adam had made up his mind to a measure, he was not the man to renounce it for any but imperative reasons. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI come to you, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cas the gentleman I look up to most of anybody.

Adam was looking on the ground, and paused a little: the next words were hard to speak. But when he went on, he lifted up his head and looked straight at Mr. Irwine. He would do the thing he had resolved to do, without flinching. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou know who\u2019s the man I\u2019ve reckoned my greatest friend,\u201d he said, \u201cand used to be proud to think as I should pass my life i\u2019 working for him, and had felt so ever since we were lads....\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mr. Irwine, as if all self-control had forsaken him, grasped Adam\u2019s arm, which lay on the table, and, clutching it tightly like a man in pain, said, with pale lips and a low hurried voice, \u201cNo, Adam, no\u2014don\u2019t say it, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam, surprised at the violence of Mr. Irwine\u2019s feeling, repented of the words that had passed his lips and sat in distressed silence. The grasp on his arm gradually relaxed, and Mr. Irwine threw himself back in his chair, saying, \u201cGo on\u2014I must know it.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat man played with Hetty\u2019s feelings, and behaved to her as he\u2019d no right to do to a girl in her station o\u2019 life\u2014made her presents and used to go and meet her out a-walking. I found it out only two days before he went away\u2014found him a-kissing her as they were parting in the Grove. There\u2019d been nothing said between me and Hetty then, though I\u2019d loved her for a long while, and she knew it. But I reproached him with his wrong actions, and words and blows passed between us; and he said solemnly to me, after that, as it had been all nonsense and no more than a bit o\u2019 flirting. But I made him write a letter to tell Hetty he\u2019d meant nothing, for I saw clear enough, sir, by several things as I hadn\u2019t understood at the time, as he\u2019d got hold of her heart, and I thought she\u2019d belike go on thinking of him and never come to love another man as wanted to marry her. And I gave her the letter, and she seemed to bear it all after a while better than I\u2019d expected... and she behaved kinder and kinder to me... I daresay she didn\u2019t know her own feelings then, poor thing, and they came back upon her when it was too late... I don\u2019t want to blame her... I can\u2019t think as she meant to deceive me. But I was encouraged to think she loved me, and\u2014you know the rest, sir. But it\u2019s on my mind as he\u2019s been false to me, and \u2019ticed her away, and she\u2019s gone to him\u2014and I\u2019m going now to see, for I can never go to work again till I know what\u2019s become of her.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  During Adam\u2019s narrative, Mr. Irwine had had time to recover his self-mastery in spite of the painful thoughts that crowded upon him. It was a bitter remembrance to him now\u2014that morning when Arthur breakfasted with him and seemed as if he were on the verge of a confession. It was plain enough ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"now")," what he had wanted to confess. And if their words had taken another turn... if he himself had been less fastidious about intruding on another man\u2019s secrets... it was cruel to think how thin a film had shut out rescue from all this guilt and misery. He saw the whole history now by that terrible illumination which the present sheds back upon the past. But every other feeling as it rushed upon him was thrown into abeyance by pity, deep respectful pity, for the man who sat before him\u2014already so bruised, going forth with sad blind resignedness to an unreal sorrow, while a real one was close upon him, too far beyond the range of common trial for him ever to have feared it. His own agitation was quelled by a certain awe that comes over us in the presence of a great anguish, for the anguish he must inflict on Adam was already present to him. Again he put his hand on the arm that lay on the table, but very gently this time, as he said solemnly: "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAdam, my dear friend, you have had some hard trials in your life. You can bear sorrow manfully, as well as act manfully. God requires both tasks at our hands. And there is a heavier sorrow coming upon you than any you have yet known.

But Mr. Irwine laid hold of his arm again and said, persuasively, \u201cWait, Adam, wait.\u201d So he sat down. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cShe is in a very unhappy position\u2014one which will make it worse for you to find her, my poor friend, than to have lost her for ever.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam\u2019s lips moved tremulously, but no sound came.

She had a small red-leather pocket-book in her pocket with two names written in it\u2014one at the beginning, \u2018Hetty Sorrel, Hayslope,\u2019 and the other near the end, \u2018Dinah Morris, Snowfield.\u2019 She will not say which is her own name\u2014she denies everything, and will answer no questions, and application has been made to me, as a magistrate, that I may take measures for identifying her, for it was thought probable that the name which stands first is her own name.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut what proof have they got against her, if it ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"is")," Hetty?\u201d said Adam, still violently, with an effort that seemed to shake his whole frame. \u201cI\u2019ll not believe it.

Mr. Irwine meanwhile went out to give some orders. When he came back, Adam\u2019s eyes were still on the first page\u2014he couldn\u2019t read\u2014he could not put the words together and make out what they meant.

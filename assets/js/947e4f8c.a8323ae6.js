Adam reached it in a quarter of an hour after leaving the Hall Farm; and when he had his hand on the door-latch, he could see, through the curtainless window, that there were eight or nine heads bending over the desks, lighted by thin dips. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  When he entered, a reading lesson was going forward and Bartle Massey merely nodded, leaving him to take his place where he pleased. He had not come for the sake of a lesson to-night, and his mind was too full of personal matters, too full of the last two hours he had passed in Hetty\u2019s presence, for him to amuse himself with a book till school was over; so he sat down in a corner and looked on with an absent mind. It was a sort of scene which Adam had beheld almost weekly for years; he knew by heart every arabesque flourish in the framed specimen of Bartle Massey\u2019s handwriting which hung over the schoolmaster\u2019s head, by way of keeping a lofty ideal before the minds of his pupils; he knew the backs of all the books on the shelf running along the whitewashed wall above the pegs for the slates; he knew exactly how many grains were gone out of the ear of Indian corn that hung from one of the rafters; he had long ago exhausted the resources of his imagination in trying to think how the bunch of leathery seaweed had looked and grown in its native element; and from the place where he sat, he could make nothing of the old map of England that hung against the opposite wall, for age had turned it of a fine yellow brown, something like that of a well-seasoned meerschaum. The drama that was going on was almost as familiar as the scene, nevertheless habit had not made him indifferent to it, and even in his present self-absorbed mood, Adam felt a momentary stirring of the old fellow-feeling, as he looked at the rough men painfully holding pen or pencil with their cramped hands, or humbly labouring through their reading lesson. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The reading class now seated on the form in front of the schoolmaster\u2019s desk consisted of the three most backward pupils. Adam would have known it only by seeing Bartle Massey\u2019s face as he looked over his spectacles, which he had shifted to the ridge of his nose, not requiring them for present purposes. The face wore its mildest expression: the grizzled bushy eyebrows had taken their more acute angle of compassionate kindness, and the mouth, habitually compressed with a pout of the lower lip, was relaxed so as to be ready to speak a helpful word or syllable in a moment. This gentle expression was the more interesting because the schoolmaster\u2019s nose, an irregular aquiline twisted a little on one side, had rather a formidable character; and his brow, moreover, had that peculiar tension which always impresses one as a sign of a keen impatient temperament: the blue veins stood out like cords under the transparent yellow skin, and this intimidating brow was softened by no tendency to baldness, for the grey bristly hair, cut down to about an inch in length, stood round it in as close ranks as ever. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, Bill, nay,\u201d Bartle was saying in a kind tone, as he nodded to Adam, \u201cbegin that again, and then perhaps, it\u2019ll come to you what d-r-y spells. It\u2019s the same lesson you read last week, you know.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBill\u201d was a sturdy fellow, aged four-and-twenty, an excellent stone-sawyer, who could get as good wages as any man in the trade of his years; but he found a reading lesson in words of one syllable a harder matter to deal with than the hardest stone he had ever had to saw. The letters, he complained, were so \u201cuncommon alike, there was no tellin\u2019 \u2019em one from another,\u201d the sawyer\u2019s business not being concerned with minute differences such as exist between a letter with its tail turned up and a letter with its tail turned down. But Bill had a firm determination that he would learn to read, founded chiefly on two reasons: first, that Tom Hazelow, his cousin, could read anything \u201cright off,\u201d whether it was print or writing, and Tom had sent him a letter from twenty miles off, saying how he was prospering in the world and had got an overlooker\u2019s place; secondly, that Sam Phillips, who sawed with him, had learned to read when he was turned twenty, and what could be done by a little fellow like Sam Phillips, Bill considered, could be done by himself, seeing that he could pound Sam into wet clay if circumstances required it. So here he was, pointing his big finger towards three words at once, and turning his head on one side that he might keep better hold with his eye of the one word which was to be discriminated out of the group. The amount of knowledge Bartle Massey must possess was something so dim and vast that Bill\u2019s imagination recoiled before it: he would hardly have ventured to deny that the schoolmaster might have something to do in bringing about the regular return of daylight and the changes in the weather. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The man seated next to Bill was of a very different type: he was a Methodist brickmaker who, after spending thirty years of his life in perfect satisfaction with his ignorance, had lately \u201cgot religion,\u201d and along with it the desire to read the Bible. But with him, too, learning was a heavy business, and on his way out to-night he had offered as usual a special prayer for help, seeing that he had undertaken this hard task with a single eye to the nourishment of his soul\u2014that he might have a greater abundance of texts and hymns wherewith to banish evil memories and the temptations of old habit\u2014or, in brief language, the devil. For the brickmaker had been a notorious poacher, and was suspected, though there was no good evidence against him, of being the man who had shot a neighbouring gamekeeper in the leg. However that might be, it is certain that shortly after the accident referred to, which was coincident with the arrival of an awakening Methodist preacher at Treddleston, a great change had been observed in the brickmaker; and though he was still known in the neighbourhood by his old sobriquet of \u201cBrimstone,\u201d there was nothing he held in so much horror as any further transactions with that evil-smelling element. He was a broad-chested fellow with a fervid temperament, which helped him better in imbibing religious ideas than in the dry process of acquiring the mere human knowledge of the alphabet. Indeed, he had been already a little shaken in his resolution by a brother Methodist, who assured him that the letter was a mere obstruction to the Spirit, and expressed a fear that Brimstone was too eager for the knowledge that puffeth up. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The third beginner was a much more promising pupil. He was a tall but thin and wiry man, nearly as old as Brimstone, with a very pale face and hands stained a deep blue. He was a dyer, who in the course of dipping homespun wool and old women\u2019s petticoats had got fired with the ambition to learn a great deal more about the strange secrets of colour. He had already a high reputation in the district for his dyes, and he was bent on discovering some method by which he could reduce the expense of crimsons and scarlets. The druggist at Treddleston had given him a notion that he might save himself a great deal of labour and expense if he could learn to read, and so he had begun to give his spare hours to the night-school, resolving that his \u201clittle chap\u201d should lose no time in coming to Mr. Massey\u2019s day-school as soon as he was old enough. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It was touching to see these three big men, with the marks of their hard labour about them, anxiously bending over the worn books and painfully making out, \u201cThe grass is green,\u201d \u201cThe sticks are dry,\u201d \u201cThe corn is ripe\u201d\u2014a very hard lesson to pass to after columns of single words all alike except in the first letter. It was almost as if three rough animals were making humble efforts to learn how they might become human. And it touched the tenderest fibre in Bartle Massey\u2019s nature, for such full-grown children as these were the only pupils for whom he had no severe epithets and no impatient tones. He was not gifted with an imperturbable temper, and on music-nights it was apparent that patience could never be an easy virtue to him; but this evening, as he glances over his spectacles at Bill Downes, the sawyer, who is turning his head on one side with a desperate sense of blankness before the letters d-r-y, his eyes shed their mildest and most encouraging light. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  After the reading class, two youths between sixteen and nineteen came up with the imaginary bills of parcels, which they had been writing out on their slates and were now required to calculate \u201coff-hand\u201d\u2014a test which they stood with such imperfect success that Bartle Massey, whose eyes had been glaring at them ominously through his spectacles for some minutes, at length burst out in a bitter, high-pitched tone, pausing between every sentence to rap the floor with a knobbed stick which rested between his legs. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow, you see, you don\u2019t do this thing a bit better than you did a fortnight ago, and I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s the reason. You want to learn accounts\u2014that\u2019s well and good. But you think all you need do to learn accounts is to come to me and do sums for an hour or so, two or three times a-week; and no sooner do you get your caps on and turn out of doors again than you sweep the whole thing clean out of your mind. You go whistling about, and take no more care what you\u2019re thinking of than if your heads were gutters for any rubbish to swill through that happened to be in the way; and if you get a good notion in \u2019em, it\u2019s pretty soon washed out again. You think knowledge is to be got cheap\u2014you\u2019ll come and pay Bartle Massey sixpence a-week, and he\u2019ll make you clever at figures without your taking any trouble. But knowledge isn\u2019t to be got with paying sixpence, let me tell you. If you\u2019re to know figures, you must turn \u2019em over in your heads and keep your thoughts fixed on \u2019em. There\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t turn into a sum, for there\u2019s nothing but what\u2019s got number in it\u2014even a fool. You may say to yourselves, \u2018I\u2019m one fool, and Jack\u2019s another; if my fool\u2019s head weighed four pound, and Jack\u2019s three pound three ounces and three quarters, how many pennyweights heavier would my head be than Jack\u2019s?\u2019 A man that had got his heart in learning figures would make sums for himself and work \u2019em in his head. When he sat at his shoemaking, he\u2019d count his stitches by fives, and then put a price on his stitches, say half a farthing, and then see how much money he could get in an hour; and then ask himself how much money he\u2019d get in a day at that rate; and then how much ten workmen would get working three, or twenty, or a hundred years at that rate\u2014and all the while his needle would be going just as fast as if he left his head empty for the devil to dance in. But the long and the short of it is\u2014I\u2019ll have nobody in my night-school that doesn\u2019t strive to learn what he comes to learn, as hard as if he was striving to get out of a dark hole into broad daylight. I\u2019ll send no man away because he\u2019s stupid: if Billy Taft, the idiot, wanted to learn anything, I\u2019d not refuse to teach him. But I\u2019ll not throw away good knowledge on people who think they can get it by the sixpenn\u2019orth, and carry it away with \u2019em as they would an ounce of snuff. So never come to me again, if you can\u2019t show that you\u2019ve been working with your own heads, instead of thinking that you can pay for mine to work for you. That\u2019s the last word I\u2019ve got to say to you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  With this final sentence, Bartle Massey gave a sharper rap than ever with his knobbed stick, and the discomfited lads got up to go with a sulky look. The other pupils had happily only their writing-books to show, in various stages of progress from pot-hooks to round text; and mere pen-strokes, however perverse, were less exasperating to Bartle than false arithmetic. He was a little more severe than usual on Jacob Storey\u2019s Z\u2019s, of which poor Jacob had written a pageful, all with their tops turned the wrong way, with a puzzled sense that they were not right \u201csomehow.\u201d But he observed in apology, that it was a letter you never wanted hardly, and he thought it had only been there \u201cto finish off th\u2019 alphabet, like, though ampusand (&) would ha\u2019 done as well, for what he could see.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  At last the pupils had all taken their hats and said their \u201cGood-nights,\u201d and Adam, knowing his old master\u2019s habits, rose and said, \u201cShall I put the candles out, Mr. Massey?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, my boy, yes, all but this, which I\u2019ll carry into the house; and just lock the outer door, now you\u2019re near it,\u201d said Bartle, getting his stick in the fitting angle to help him in descending from his stool. He was no sooner on the ground than it became obvious why the stick was necessary\u2014the left leg was much shorter than the right. But the school-master was so active with his lameness that it was hardly thought of as a misfortune; and if you had seen him make his way along the schoolroom floor, and up the step into his kitchen, you would perhaps have understood why the naughty boys sometimes felt that his pace might be indefinitely quickened and that he and his stick might overtake them even in their swiftest run. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The moment he appeared at the kitchen door with the candle in his hand, a faint whimpering began in the chimney-corner, and a brown-and-tan-coloured bitch, of that wise-looking breed with short legs and long body, known to an unmechanical generation as turnspits, came creeping along the floor, wagging her tail, and hesitating at every other step, as if her affections were painfully divided between the hamper in the chimney-corner and the master, whom she could not leave without a greeting. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, Vixen, well then, how are the babbies?\u201d said the schoolmaster, making haste towards the chimney-corner and holding the candle over the low hamper, where two extremely blind puppies lifted up their heads towards the light from a nest of flannel and wool. Vixen could not even see her master look at them without painful excitement: she got into the hamper and got out again the next moment, and behaved with true feminine folly, though looking all the while as wise as a dwarf with a large old-fashioned head and body on the most abbreviated legs. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, you\u2019ve got a family, I see, Mr. Massey?\u201d said Adam, smiling, as he came into the kitchen. \u201cHow\u2019s that? I thought it was against the law here.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLaw? What\u2019s the use o\u2019 law when a man\u2019s once such a fool as to let a woman into his house?\u201d said Bartle, turning away from the hamper with some bitterness. He always called Vixen a woman, and seemed to have lost all consciousness that he was using a figure of speech. \u201cIf I\u2019d known Vixen was a woman, I\u2019d never have held the boys from drowning her; but when I\u2019d got her into my hand, I was forced to take to her. And now you see what she\u2019s brought me to\u2014the sly, hypocritical wench\u201d\u2014Bartle spoke these last words in a rasping tone of reproach, and looked at Vixen, who poked down her head and turned up her eyes towards him with a keen sense of opprobrium\u2014\u201cand contrived to be brought to bed on a Sunday at church-time. I\u2019ve wished again and again I\u2019d been a bloody minded man, that I could have strangled the mother and the brats with one cord.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m glad it was no worse a cause kept you from church,\u201d said Adam. \u201cI was afraid you must be ill for the first time i\u2019 your life. And I was particularly sorry not to have you at church yesterday.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, my boy, I know why, I know why,\u201d said Bartle kindly, going up to Adam and raising his hand up to the shoulder that was almost on a level with his own head. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a rough bit o\u2019 road to get over since I saw you\u2014a rough bit o\u2019 road. But I\u2019m in hopes there are better times coming for you. I\u2019ve got some news to tell you. But I must get my supper first, for I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019m hungry. Sit down, sit down.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Bartel went into his little pantry, and brought out an excellent home-baked loaf; for it was his one extravagance in these dear times to eat bread once a-day instead of oat-cake; and he justified it by observing, that what a schoolmaster wanted was brains, and oat-cake ran too much to bone instead of brains. Then came a piece of cheese and a quart jug with a crown of foam upon it. He placed them all on the round deal table which stood against his large arm-chair in the chimney-corner, with Vixen\u2019s hamper on one side of it and a window-shelf with a few books piled up in it on the other. The table was as clean as if Vixen had been an excellent housewife in a checkered apron; so was the quarry floor; and the old carved oaken press, table, and chairs, which in these days would be bought at a high price in aristocratic houses, though, in that period of spider-legs and inlaid cupids, Bartle had got them for an old song, were as free from dust as things could be at the end of a summer\u2019s day. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow, then, my boy, draw up, draw up. We\u2019ll not talk about business till we\u2019ve had our supper. No man can be wise on an empty stomach. But,\u201d said Bartle, rising from his chair again, \u201cI must give Vixen her supper too, confound her! Though she\u2019ll do nothing with it but nourish those unnecessary babbies. That\u2019s the way with these women\u2014they\u2019ve got no head-pieces to nourish, and so their food all runs either to fat or to brats.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He brought out of the pantry a dish of scraps, which Vixen at once fixed her eyes on, and jumped out of her hamper to lick up with the utmost dispatch. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ve had my supper, Mr. Massey,\u201d said Adam, \u201cso I\u2019ll look on while you eat yours.

There\u2019s too many women in the house for me: I hate the sound of women\u2019s voices; they\u2019re always either a-buzz or a-squeak\u2014always either a-buzz or a-squeak. Mrs. Poyser keeps at the top o\u2019 the talk like a fife; and as for the young lasses, I\u2019d as soon look at water-grubs. I know what they\u2019ll turn to\u2014stinging gnats, stinging gnats. Here, take some ale, my boy: it\u2019s been drawn for you\u2014it\u2019s been drawn for you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, Mr. Massey,\u201d said Adam, who took his old friend\u2019s whim more seriously than usual to-night, \u201cdon\u2019t be so hard on the creaturs God has made to be companions for us. A working-man \u2019ud be badly off without a wife to see to th\u2019 house and the victual, and make things clean and comfortable.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNonsense! It\u2019s the silliest lie a sensible man like you ever believed, to say a woman makes a house comfortable. It\u2019s a story got up because the women are there and something must be found for \u2019em to do. I tell you there isn\u2019t a thing under the sun that needs to be done at all, but what a man can do better than a woman, unless it\u2019s bearing children, and they do that in a poor make-shift way; it had better ha\u2019 been left to the men\u2014it had better ha\u2019 been left to the men. I tell you, a woman \u2019ull bake you a pie every week of her life and never come to see that the hotter th\u2019 oven the shorter the time.

The porridge ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"will")," be awk\u2019ard now and then: if it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s summat in the meal, or it\u2019s summat in the milk, or it\u2019s summat in the water. Look at me! I make my own bread, and there\u2019s no difference between one batch and another from year\u2019s end to year\u2019s end; but if I\u2019d got any other woman besides Vixen in the house, I must pray to the Lord every baking to give me patience if the bread turned out heavy. And as for cleanliness, my house is cleaner than any other house on the Common, though the half of \u2019em swarm with women. Will Baker\u2019s lad comes to help me in a morning, and we get as much cleaning done in one hour, without any fuss, as a woman \u2019ud get done in three, and all the while be sending buckets o\u2019 water after your ankles, and let the fender and the fire-irons stand in the middle o\u2019 the floor half the day for you to break your shins against \u2019em. Don\u2019t tell me about God having made such creatures to be companions for us! I don\u2019t say but He might make Eve to be a companion to Adam in Paradise\u2014there was no cooking to be spoilt there, and no other woman to cackle with and make mischief, though you see what mischief she did as soon as she\u2019d an opportunity. But it\u2019s an impious, unscriptural opinion to say a woman\u2019s a blessing to a man now; you might as well say adders and wasps, and foxes and wild beasts are a blessing, when they\u2019re only the evils that belong to this state o\u2019 probation, which it\u2019s lawful for a man to keep as clear of as he can in this life, hoping to get quit of \u2019em for ever in another\u2014hoping to get quit of \u2019em for ever in another.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Bartle had become so excited and angry in the course of his invective that he had forgotten his supper, and only used the knife for the purpose of rapping the table with the haft. But towards the close, the raps became so sharp and frequent, and his voice so quarrelsome, that Vixen felt it incumbent on her to jump out of the hamper and bark vaguely. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cQuiet, Vixen!\u201d snarled Bartle, turning round upon her. \u201cYou\u2019re like the rest o\u2019 the women\u2014always putting in ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"your")," word before you know why.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Vixen returned to her hamper again in humiliation, and her master continued his supper in a silence which Adam did not choose to interrupt; he knew the old man would be in a better humour when he had had his supper and lighted his pipe. Adam was used to hear him talk in this way, but had never learned so much of Bartle\u2019s past life as to know whether his view of married comfort was founded on experience. On that point Bartle was mute, and it was even a secret where he had lived previous to the twenty years in which happily for the peasants and artisans of this neighbourhood he had been settled among them as their only schoolmaster. If anything like a question was ventured on this subject, Bartle always replied, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen many places\u2014I\u2019ve been a deal in the south,\u201d and the Loamshire men would as soon have thought of asking for a particular town or village in Africa as in \u201cthe south.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow then, my boy,\u201d said Bartle, at last, when he had poured out his second mug of ale and lighted his pipe, \u201cnow then, we\u2019ll have a little talk. But tell me first, have you heard any particular news to-day?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo,\u201d said Adam, \u201cnot as I remember.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, they\u2019ll keep it close, they\u2019ll keep it close, I daresay.

Your impatient loquacious man has never any notion of keeping his pipe alight by gentle measured puffs; he is always letting it go nearly out, and then punishing it for that negligence. At last he said, \u201cSatchell\u2019s got a paralytic stroke. I found it out from the lad they sent to Treddleston for the doctor, before seven o\u2019clock this morning. He\u2019s a good way beyond sixty, you know; it\u2019s much if he gets over it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d said Adam, \u201cI daresay there\u2019d be more rejoicing than sorrow in the parish at his being laid up. He\u2019s been a selfish, tale-bearing, mischievous fellow; but, after all, there\u2019s nobody he\u2019s done so much harm to as to th\u2019 old squire. Though it\u2019s the squire himself as is to blame\u2014making a stupid fellow like that a sort o\u2019 man-of-all-work, just to save th\u2019 expense of having a proper steward to look after th\u2019 estate. And he\u2019s lost more by ill management o\u2019 the woods, I\u2019ll be bound, than \u2019ud pay for two stewards. If he\u2019s laid on the shelf, it\u2019s to be hoped he\u2019ll make way for a better man, but I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s like to make any difference to me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut I see it, but I see it,\u201d said Bartle, \u201cand others besides me. The captain\u2019s coming of age now\u2014you know that as well as I do\u2014and it\u2019s to be expected he\u2019ll have a little more voice in things. And I know, and you know too, what \u2019ud be the captain\u2019s wish about the woods, if there was a fair opportunity for making a change. He\u2019s said in plenty of people\u2019s hearing that he\u2019d make you manager of the woods to-morrow, if he\u2019d the power. Why, Carroll, Mr. Irwine\u2019s butler, heard him say so to the parson not many days ago. Carroll looked in when we were smoking our pipes o\u2019 Saturday night at Casson\u2019s, and he told us about it; and whenever anybody says a good word for you, the parson\u2019s ready to back it, that I\u2019ll answer for. It was pretty well talked over, I can tell you, at Casson\u2019s, and one and another had their fling at you; for if donkeys set to work to sing, you\u2019re pretty sure what the tune\u2019ll be.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, did they talk it over before Mr. Burge?\u201d said Adam; \u201cor wasn\u2019t he there o\u2019 Saturday?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, he went away before Carroll came; and Casson\u2014he\u2019s always for setting other folks right, you know\u2014would have it Burge was the man to have the management of the woods. \u2018A substantial man,\u2019 says he, \u2018with pretty near sixty years\u2019 experience o\u2019 timber: it \u2019ud be all very well for Adam Bede to act under him, but it isn\u2019t to be supposed the squire \u2019ud appoint a young fellow like Adam, when there\u2019s his elders and betters at hand!\u2019 But I said, \u2018That\u2019s a pretty notion o\u2019 yours, Casson. Why, Burge is the man to ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"buy")," timber; would you put the woods into his hands and let him make his own bargains? I think you don\u2019t leave your customers to score their own drink, do you? And as for age, what that\u2019s worth depends on the quality o\u2019 the liquor. It\u2019s pretty well known who\u2019s the backbone of Jonathan Burge\u2019s business.\u2019\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI thank you for your good word, Mr. Massey,\u201d said Adam. \u201cBut, for all that, Casson was partly i\u2019 the right for once. There\u2019s not much likelihood that th\u2019 old squire \u2019ud ever consent t\u2019 employ me. I offended him about two years ago, and he\u2019s never forgiven me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, how was that? You never told me about it,\u201d said Bartle. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, it was a bit o\u2019 nonsense. I\u2019d made a frame for a screen for Miss Lyddy\u2014she\u2019s allays making something with her worsted-work, you know\u2014and she\u2019d given me particular orders about this screen, and there was as much talking and measuring as if we\u2019d been planning a house. However, it was a nice bit o\u2019 work, and I liked doing it for her. But, you know, those little friggling things take a deal o\u2019 time. I only worked at it in overhours\u2014often late at night\u2014and I had to go to Treddleston over an\u2019 over again about little bits o\u2019 brass nails and such gear; and I turned the little knobs and the legs, and carved th\u2019 open work, after a pattern, as nice as could be. And I was uncommon pleased with it when it was done. And when I took it home, Miss Lyddy sent for me to bring it into her drawing-room, so as she might give me directions about fastening on the work\u2014very fine needlework, Jacob and Rachel a-kissing one another among the sheep, like a picture\u2014and th\u2019 old squire was sitting there, for he mostly sits with her. Well, she was mighty pleased with the screen, and then she wanted to know what pay she was to give me. I didn\u2019t speak at random\u2014you know it\u2019s not my way; I\u2019d calculated pretty close, though I hadn\u2019t made out a bill, and I said, \u2018One pound thirteen.\u2019 That was paying for the mater\u2019als and paying me, but none too much, for my work. Th\u2019 old squire looked up at this, and peered in his way at the screen, and said, \u2018One pound thirteen for a gimcrack like that! Lydia, my dear, if you must spend money on these things, why don\u2019t you get them at Rosseter, instead of paying double price for clumsy work here? Such things are not work for a carpenter like Adam. Give him a guinea, and no more.\u2019 Well, Miss Lyddy, I reckon, believed what he told her, and she\u2019s not overfond o\u2019 parting with the money herself\u2014she\u2019s not a bad woman at bottom, but she\u2019s been brought up under his thumb; so she began fidgeting with her purse, and turned as red as her ribbon. But I made a bow, and said, \u2018No, thank you, madam; I\u2019ll make you a present o\u2019 the screen, if you please. I\u2019ve charged the regular price for my work, and I know it\u2019s done well; and I know, begging His Honour\u2019s pardon, that you couldn\u2019t get such a screen at Rosseter under two guineas. I\u2019m willing to give you my work\u2014it\u2019s been done in my own time, and nobody\u2019s got anything to do with it but me; but if I\u2019m paid, I can\u2019t take a smaller price than I asked, because that \u2019ud be like saying I\u2019d asked more than was just. With your leave, madam, I\u2019ll bid you good-morning.\u2019 I made my bow and went out before she\u2019d time to say any more, for she stood with the purse in her hand, looking almost foolish. I didn\u2019t mean to be disrespectful, and I spoke as polite as I could; but I can give in to no man, if he wants to make it out as I\u2019m trying to overreach him. And in the evening the footman brought me the one pound thirteen wrapped in paper. But since then I\u2019ve seen pretty clear as th\u2019 old squire can\u2019t abide me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat\u2019s likely enough, that\u2019s likely enough,\u201d said Bartle meditatively. \u201cThe only way to bring him round would be to show him what was for his own interest, and that the captain may do\u2014that the captain may do.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Adam; \u201cthe squire\u2019s \u2019cute enough but it takes something else besides \u2019cuteness to make folks see what\u2019ll be their interest in the long run. It takes some conscience and belief in right and wrong, I see that pretty clear. You\u2019d hardly ever bring round th\u2019 old squire to believe he\u2019d gain as much in a straightfor\u2019ard way as by tricks and turns. And, besides, I\u2019ve not much mind to work under him: I don\u2019t want to quarrel with any gentleman, more particular an old gentleman turned eighty, and I know we couldn\u2019t agree long. If the captain was master o\u2019 th\u2019 estate, it \u2019ud be different: he\u2019s got a conscience and a will to do right, and I\u2019d sooner work for him nor for any man living.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, well, my boy, if good luck knocks at your door, don\u2019t you put your head out at window and tell it to be gone about its business, that\u2019s all. You must learn to deal with odd and even in life, as well as in figures. I tell you now, as I told you ten years ago, when you pommelled young Mike Holdsworth for wanting to pass a bad shilling before you knew whether he was in jest or earnest\u2014you\u2019re overhasty and proud, and apt to set your teeth against folks that don\u2019t square to your notions. It\u2019s no harm for me to be a bit fiery and stiff-backed\u2014I\u2019m an old schoolmaster, and shall never want to get on to a higher perch. But where\u2019s the use of all the time I\u2019ve spent in teaching you writing and mapping and mensuration, if you\u2019re not to get for\u2019ard in the world and show folks there\u2019s some advantage in having a head on your shoulders, instead of a turnip? Do you mean to go on turning up your nose at every opportunity because it\u2019s got a bit of a smell about it that nobody finds out but yourself? It\u2019s as foolish as that notion o\u2019 yours that a wife is to make a working-man comfortable. Stuff and nonsense! Stuff and nonsense! Leave that to fools that never got beyond a sum in simple addition. Simple addition enough! Add one fool to another fool, and in six years\u2019 time six fools more\u2014they\u2019re all of the same denomination, big and little\u2019s nothing to do with the sum!\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  During this rather heated exhortation to coolness and discretion the pipe had gone out, and Bartle gave the climax to his speech by striking a light furiously, after which he puffed with fierce resolution, fixing his eye still on Adam, who was trying not to laugh.

What I\u2019ve got to do is to work as well as I can with the tools and mater\u2019als I\u2019ve got in my hands. If a good chance comes to me, I\u2019ll think o\u2019 what you\u2019ve been saying; but till then, I\u2019ve got nothing to do but to trust to my own hands and my own head-piece.

But it\u2019s getting late now\u2014it\u2019ll be pretty near eleven before I\u2019m at home, and Mother may happen to lie awake; she\u2019s more fidgety nor usual now.

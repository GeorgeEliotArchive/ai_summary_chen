The moment wrought strongly on Deronda\u2019s imaginative susceptibility: in the presence of one linked still in zealous friendship with the grandfather whose hope had yearned toward him when he was unborn, and who, though dead, was yet to speak with him in those written memorials which, says Milton, \u201ccontain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul whose progeny they are,\u201d he seemed to himself to be touching the electric chain of his own ancestry; and he bore the scrutinizing look of Kalonymos with a delighted awe, something like what one feels in the solemn commemoration of acts done long ago but still telling markedly on the life of to-day. Impossible for men of duller fibre\u2014men whose affection is not ready to diffuse itself through the wide travel of imagination, to comprehend, perhaps even to credit this sensibility of Deronda\u2019s; but it subsisted, like their own dullness, notwithstanding their lack of belief in it\u2014and it gave his face an expression which seemed very satisfactory to the observer.

He had an iron will in his face: it braced up everybody about him. When he was quite young he had already got one deep upright line in his brow. I see none of that in you. Daniel Charisi used to say, \u2018Better, a wrong will than a wavering; better a steadfast enemy than an uncertain friend; better a false belief than no belief at all.\u2019 What he despised most was indifference.

But he early took to medicine and theories about life and health. He traveled to many countries, and spent much of his substance in seeing and knowing. What he used to insist on was that the strength and wealth of mankind depended on the balance of separateness and communication, and he was bitterly against our people losing themselves among the Gentiles; \u2018It\u2019s no better,\u2019 said he, \u2018than the many sorts of grain going back from their variety into sameness.\u2019 He mingled all sorts of learning; and in that he was like our Arabic writers in the golden time. We studied together, but he went beyond me. Though we were bosom friends, and he poured himself out to me, we were as different as the inside and outside of the bowl. I stood up for two notions of my own: I took Charisi\u2019s sayings as I took the shape of the trees: they were there, not to be disputed about. It came to the same thing in both of us; we were both faithful Jews, thankful not to be Gentiles. And since I was a ripe man, I have been what I am now, for all but age\u2014loving to wander, loving transactions, loving to behold all things, and caring nothing about hardship. Charisi thought continually of our people\u2019s future: he went with all his soul into that part of our religion: I, not. So we have freedom, I am content. Our people wandered before they were driven. Young man when I am in the East, I lie much on deck and watch the greater stars. The sight of them satisfies me. I know them as they rise, and hunger not to know more. Charisi was satisfied with no sight, but pieced it out with what had been before and what would come after. Yet we loved each other, and as he said, he bound our love with duty; we solemnly pledged ourselves to help and defend each other to the last. I have fulfilled my pledge.\u201d Here Kalonymos rose, and Deronda, rising also, said, "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cAnd in being faithful to him you have caused justice to be done to me.

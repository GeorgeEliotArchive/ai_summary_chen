And, besides this, there was a grand band hired from Rosseter, who, with their wonderful wind-instruments and puffed-out cheeks, were themselves a delightful show to the small boys and girls. To say nothing of Joshua Rann\u2019s fiddle, which, by an act of generous forethought, he had provided himself with, in case any one should be of sufficiently pure taste to prefer dancing to a solo on that instrument. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Meantime, when the sun had moved off the great open space in front of the house, the games began. There were, of course, well-soaped poles to be climbed by the boys and youths, races to be run by the old women, races to be run in sacks, heavy weights to be lifted by the strong men, and a long list of challenges to such ambitious attempts as that of walking as many yards possible on one leg\u2014feats in which it was generally remarked that Wiry Ben, being \u201cthe lissom\u2019st, springest fellow i\u2019 the country,\u201d was sure to be pre-eminent. To crown all, there was to be a donkey-race\u2014that sublimest of all races, conducted on the grand socialistic idea of everybody encouraging everybody else\u2019s donkey, and the sorriest donkey winning. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  And soon after four o\u2019clock, splendid old Mrs. Irwine, in her damask satin and jewels and black lace, was led out by Arthur, followed by the whole family party, to her raised seat under the striped marquee, where she was to give out the prizes to the victors. Staid, formal Miss Lydia had requested to resign that queenly office to the royal old lady, and Arthur was pleased with this opportunity of gratifying his godmother\u2019s taste for stateliness. Old Mr. Donnithorne, the delicately clean, finely scented, withered old man, led out Miss Irwine, with his air of punctilious, acid politeness; Mr. Gawaine brought Miss Lydia, looking neutral and stiff in an elegant peach-blossom silk; and Mr. Irwine came last with his pale sister Anne. No other friend of the family, besides Mr. Gawaine, was invited to-day; there was to be a grand dinner for the neighbouring gentry on the morrow, but to-day all the forces were required for the entertainment of the tenants. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  There was a sunk fence in front of the marquee, dividing the lawn from the park, but a temporary bridge had been made for the passage of the victors, and the groups of people standing, or seated here and there on benches, stretched on each side of the open space from the white marquees up to the sunk fence. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cUpon my word it\u2019s a pretty sight,\u201d said the old lady, in her deep voice, when she was seated, and looked round on the bright scene with its dark-green background; \u201cand it\u2019s the last f\xeate-day I\u2019m likely to see, unless you make haste and get married, Arthur. But take care you get a charming bride, else I would rather die without seeing her.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019re so terribly fastidious, Godmother,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I should never satisfy you with my choice.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, I won\u2019t forgive you if she\u2019s not handsome. I can\u2019t be put off with amiability, which is always the excuse people are making for the existence of plain people. And she must not be silly; that will never do, because you\u2019ll want managing, and a silly woman can\u2019t manage you. Who is that tall young man, Dauphin, with the mild face? There, standing without his hat, and taking such care of that tall old woman by the side of him\u2014his mother, of course. I like to see that.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat, don\u2019t you know him, Mother?\u201d said Mr. Irwine. \u201cThat is Seth Bede, Adam\u2019s brother\u2014a Methodist, but a very good fellow. Poor Seth has looked rather down-hearted of late; I thought it was because of his father\u2019s dying in that sad way, but Joshua Rann tells me he wanted to marry that sweet little Methodist preacher who was here about a month ago, and I suppose she refused him.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, I remember hearing about her. But there are no end of people here that I don\u2019t know, for they\u2019re grown up and altered so since I used to go about.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat excellent sight you have!\u201d said old Mr. Donnithorne, who was holding a double glass up to his eyes, \u201cto see the expression of that young man\u2019s face so far off. His face is nothing but a pale blurred spot to me. But I fancy I have the advantage of you when we come to look close. I can read small print without spectacles.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, my dear sir, you began with being very near-sighted, and those near-sighted eyes always wear the best. I want very strong spectacles to read with, but then I think my eyes get better and better for things at a distance. I suppose if I could live another fifty years, I should be blind to everything that wasn\u2019t out of other people\u2019s sight, like a man who stands in a well and sees nothing but the stars.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSee,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cthe old women are ready to set out on their race now. Which do you bet on, Gawaine?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThe long-legged one, unless they\u2019re going to have several heats, and then the little wiry one may win.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere are the Poysers, Mother, not far off on the right hand,\u201d said Miss Irwine. \u201cMrs. Poyser is looking at you. Do take notice of her.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTo be sure I will,\u201d said the old lady, giving a gracious bow to Mrs. Poyser. \u201cA woman who sends me such excellent cream-cheese is not to be neglected. Bless me! What a fat child that is she is holding on her knee! But who is that pretty girl with dark eyes?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat is Hetty Sorrel,\u201d said Miss Lydia Donnithorne, \u201cMartin Poyser\u2019s niece\u2014a very likely young person, and well-looking too. My maid has taught her fine needlework, and she has mended some lace of mine very respectably indeed\u2014very respectably.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, she has lived with the Poysers six or seven years, Mother; you must have seen her,\u201d said Miss Irwine. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never seen her, child\u2014at least not as she is now,\u201d said Mrs. Irwine, continuing to look at Hetty. \u201cWell-looking, indeed! She\u2019s a perfect beauty! I\u2019ve never seen anything so pretty since my young days. What a pity such beauty as that should be thrown away among the farmers, when it\u2019s wanted so terribly among the good families without fortune! I daresay, now, she\u2019ll marry a man who would have thought her just as pretty if she had had round eyes and red hair.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur dared not turn his eyes towards Hetty while Mrs. Irwine was speaking of her. He feigned not to hear, and to be occupied with something on the opposite side. But he saw her plainly enough without looking; saw her in heightened beauty, because he heard her beauty praised\u2014for other men\u2019s opinion, you know, was like a native climate to Arthur\u2019s feelings: it was the air on which they thrived the best, and grew strong. Yes! She ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"was")," enough to turn any man\u2019s head: any man in his place would have done and felt the same. And to give her up after all, as he was determined to do, would be an act that he should always look back upon with pride. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, Mother,\u201d and Mr. Irwine, replying to her last words; \u201cI can\u2019t agree with you there. The common people are not quite so stupid as you imagine. The commonest man, who has his ounce of sense and feeling, is conscious of the difference between a lovely, delicate woman and a coarse one. Even a dog feels a difference in their presence. The man may be no better able than the dog to explain the influence the more refined beauty has on him, but he feels it.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBless me, Dauphin, what does an old bachelor like you know about it?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, that is one of the matters in which old bachelors are wiser than married men, because they have time for more general contemplation. Your fine critic of woman must never shackle his judgment by calling one woman his own. But, as an example of what I was saying, that pretty Methodist preacher I mentioned just now told me that she had preached to the roughest miners and had never been treated with anything but the utmost respect and kindness by them. The reason is\u2014though she doesn\u2019t know it\u2014that there\u2019s so much tenderness, refinement, and purity about her. Such a woman as that brings with her \u2018airs from heaven\u2019 that the coarsest fellow is not insensible to.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHere\u2019s a delicate bit of womanhood, or girlhood, coming to receive a prize, I suppose,\u201d said Mr. Gawaine. \u201cShe must be one of the racers in the sacks, who had set off before we came.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The \u201cbit of womanhood\u201d was our old acquaintance Bessy Cranage, otherwise Chad\u2019s Bess, whose large red cheeks and blowsy person had undergone an exaggeration of colour, which, if she had happened to be a heavenly body, would have made her sublime. Bessy, I am sorry to say, had taken to her ear-rings again since Dinah\u2019s departure, and was otherwise decked out in such small finery as she could muster. Any one who could have looked into poor Bessy\u2019s heart would have seen a striking resemblance between her little hopes and anxieties and Hetty\u2019s. The advantage, perhaps, would have been on Bessy\u2019s side in the matter of feeling. But then, you see, they were so very different outside! You would have been inclined to box Bessy\u2019s ears, and you would have longed to kiss Hetty. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Bessy had been tempted to run the arduous race, partly from mere hedonish gaiety, partly because of the prize. Some one had said there were to be cloaks and other nice clothes for prizes, and she approached the marquee, fanning herself with her handkerchief, but with exultation sparkling in her round eyes. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHere is the prize for the first sack-race,\u201d said Miss Lydia, taking a large parcel from the table where the prizes were laid and giving it to Mrs. Irwine before Bessy came up, \u201can excellent grogram gown and a piece of flannel.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou didn\u2019t think the winner was to be so young, I suppose, Aunt?\u201d said Arthur. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you find something else for this girl, and save that grim-looking gown for one of the older women?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI have bought nothing but what is useful and substantial,\u201d said Miss Lydia, adjusting her own lace; \u201cI should not think of encouraging a love of finery in young women of that class. I have a scarlet cloak, but that is for the old woman who wins.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  This speech of Miss Lydia\u2019s produced rather a mocking expression in Mrs. Irwine\u2019s face as she looked at Arthur, while Bessy came up and dropped a series of curtsies. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThis is Bessy Cranage, mother,\u201d said Mr. Irwine, kindly, \u201cChad Cranage\u2019s daughter. You remember Chad Cranage, the blacksmith?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, to be sure,\u201d said Mrs. Irwine. \u201cWell, Bessy, here is your prize\u2014excellent warm things for winter. I\u2019m sure you have had hard work to win them this warm day.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Bessy\u2019s lip fell as she saw the ugly, heavy gown\u2014which felt so hot and disagreeable too, on this July day, and was such a great ugly thing to carry. She dropped her curtsies again, without looking up, and with a growing tremulousness about the corners of her mouth, and then turned away. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cPoor girl,\u201d said Arthur; \u201cI think she\u2019s disappointed. I wish it had been something more to her taste.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cShe\u2019s a bold-looking young person,\u201d observed Miss Lydia. \u201cNot at all one I should like to encourage.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur silently resolved that he would make Bessy a present of money before the day was over, that she might buy something more to her mind; but she, not aware of the consolation in store for her, turned out of the open space, where she was visible from the marquee, and throwing down the odious bundle under a tree, began to cry\u2014very much tittered at the while by the small boys. In this situation she was descried by her discreet matronly cousin, who lost no time in coming up, having just given the baby into her husband\u2019s charge. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter wi\u2019 ye?\u201d said Bess the matron, taking up the bundle and examining it. \u201cYe\u2019n sweltered yoursen, I reckon, running that fool\u2019s race. An\u2019 here, they\u2019n gi\u2019en you lots o\u2019 good grogram and flannel, as should ha\u2019 been gi\u2019en by good rights to them as had the sense to keep away from such foolery. Ye might spare me a bit o\u2019 this grogram to make clothes for the lad\u2014ye war ne\u2019er ill-natured, Bess; I ne\u2019er said that on ye.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYe may take it all, for what I care,\u201d said Bess the maiden, with a pettish movement, beginning to wipe away her tears and recover herself. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, I could do wi\u2019t, if so be ye want to get rid on\u2019t,\u201d said the disinterested cousin, walking quickly away with the bundle, lest Chad\u2019s Bess should change her mind. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  But that bonny-cheeked lass was blessed with an elasticity of spirits that secured her from any rankling grief; and by the time the grand climax of the donkey-race came on, her disappointment was entirely lost in the delightful excitement of attempting to stimulate the last donkey by hisses, while the boys applied the argument of sticks. But the strength of the donkey mind lies in adopting a course inversely as the arguments urged, which, well considered, requires as great a mental force as the direct sequence; and the present donkey proved the first-rate order of his intelligence by coming to a dead standstill just when the blows were thickest. Great was the shouting of the crowd, radiant the grinning of Bill Downes the stone-sawyer and the fortunate rider of this superior beast, which stood calm and stiff-legged in the midst of its triumph. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur himself had provided the prizes for the men, and Bill was made happy with a splendid pocket-knife, supplied with blades and gimlets enough to make a man at home on a desert island. He had hardly returned from the marquee with the prize in his hand, when it began to be understood that Wiry Ben proposed to amuse the company, before the gentry went to dinner, with an impromptu and gratuitous performance\u2014namely, a hornpipe, the main idea of which was doubtless borrowed; but this was to be developed by the dancer in so peculiar and complex a manner that no one could deny him the praise of originality. Wiry Ben\u2019s pride in his dancing\u2014an accomplishment productive of great effect at the yearly Wake\u2014had needed only slightly elevating by an extra quantity of good ale to convince him that the gentry would be very much struck with his performance of his hornpipe; and he had been decidedly encouraged in this idea by Joshua Rann, who observed that it was nothing but right to do something to please the young squire, in return for what he had done for them. You will be the less surprised at this opinion in so grave a personage when you learn that Ben had requested Mr. Rann to accompany him on the fiddle, and Joshua felt quite sure that though there might not be much in the dancing, the music would make up for it. Adam Bede, who was present in one of the large marquees, where the plan was being discussed, told Ben he had better not make a fool of himself\u2014a remark which at once fixed Ben\u2019s determination: he was not going to let anything alone because Adam Bede turned up his nose at it. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat\u2019s this, what\u2019s this?\u201d said old Mr. Donnithorne. \u201cIs it something you\u2019ve arranged, Arthur? Here\u2019s the clerk coming with his fiddle, and a smart fellow with a nosegay in his button-hole.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo,\u201d said Arthur; \u201cI know nothing about it. By Jove, he\u2019s going to dance! It\u2019s one of the carpenters\u2014I forget his name at this moment.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s Ben Cranage\u2014Wiry Ben, they call him,\u201d said Mr. Irwine; \u201crather a loose fish, I think. Anne, my dear, I see that fiddle-scraping is too much for you: you\u2019re getting tired. Let me take you in now, that you may rest till dinner.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Miss Anne rose assentingly, and the good brother took her away, while Joshua\u2019s preliminary scrapings burst into the \u201cWhite Cockade,\u201d from which he intended to pass to a variety of tunes, by a series of transitions which his good ear really taught him to execute with some skill. It would have been an exasperating fact to him, if he had known it, that the general attention was too thoroughly absorbed by Ben\u2019s dancing for any one to give much heed to the music. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Have you ever seen a real English rustic perform a solo dance? Perhaps you have only seen a ballet rustic, smiling like a merry countryman in crockery, with graceful turns of the haunch and insinuating movements of the head. That is as much like the real thing as the \u201cBird Waltz\u201d is like the song of birds. Wiry Ben never smiled: he looked as serious as a dancing monkey\u2014as serious as if he had been an experimental philosopher ascertaining in his own person the amount of shaking and the varieties of angularity that could be given to the human limbs. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  To make amends for the abundant laughter in the striped marquee, Arthur clapped his hands continually and cried \u201cBravo!\u201d But Ben had one admirer whose eyes followed his movements with a fervid gravity that equalled his own.

If ever a girl looked as if she had been made of roses, that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock. For her hat was trimmed with pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a white ground. There was nothing but pink and white about her, except in her dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser was provoked at herself, for she could hardly keep from smiling, as any mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things. So she turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door, followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she trod on. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon having a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from that promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted by Mrs. Poyser\u2019s own hand, setting off the proportions of his leg. Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf. Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face, which was good humour itself as he said, \u201cCome, Hetty\u2014come, little uns!\u201d and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway gate into the yard. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The \u201clittle uns\u201d addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and seven, in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by rosy cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very small elephant is like a very large one. Hetty walked between them, and behind came patient Molly, whose task it was to carry Totty through the yard and over all the wet places on the road; for Totty, having speedily recovered from her threatened fever, had insisted on going to church to-day, and especially on wearing her red-and-black necklace outside her tippet. And there were many wet places for her to be carried over this afternoon, for there had been heavy showers in the morning, though now the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering silvery masses on the horizon. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the farmyard. The cocks and hens seemed to know it, and made only crooning subdued noises; the very bull-dog looked less savage, as if he would have been satisfied with a smaller bite than usual. The sunshine seemed to call all things to rest and not to labour. It was asleep itself on the moss-grown cow-shed; on the group of white ducks nestling together with their bills tucked under their wings; on the old black sow stretched languidly on the straw, while her largest young one found an excellent spring-bed on his mother\u2019s fat ribs; on Alick, the shepherd, in his new smock-frock, taking an uneasy siesta, half-sitting, half-standing on the granary steps. Alick was of opinion that church, like other luxuries, was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who had the weather and the ewes on his mind. \u201cChurch! Nay\u2014I\u2019n gotten summat else to think on,\u201d was an answer which he often uttered in a tone of bitter significance that silenced further question. I feel sure Alick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his mind was not of a speculative, negative cast, and he would on no account have missed going to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and \u201cWhissuntide.\u201d But he had a general impression that public worship and religious ceremonies, like other non-productive employments, were intended for people who had leisure.

He always went to church on Sacrament Sundays, but not very regularly at other times; on wet Sundays, or whenever he had a touch of rheumatism, he used to read the three first chapters of Genesis instead.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  And when they were all gone, the old man leaned on the gate again, watching them across the lane along the Home Close, and through the far gate, till they disappeared behind a bend in the hedge. For the hedgerows in those days shut out one\u2019s view, even on the better-managed farms; and this afternoon, the dog-roses were tossing out their pink wreaths, the nightshade was in its yellow and purple glory, the pale honeysuckle grew out of reach, peeping high up out of a holly bush, and over all an ash or a sycamore every now and then threw its shadow across the path. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside and let them pass: at the gate of the Home Close there was half the dairy of cows standing one behind the other, extremely slow to understand that their large bodies might be in the way; at the far gate there was the mare holding her head over the bars, and beside her the liver-coloured foal with its head towards its mother\u2019s flank, apparently still much embarrassed by its own straddling existence. The way lay entirely through Mr. Poyser\u2019s own fields till they reached the main road leading to the village, and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops as they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running commentary on them all. The woman who manages a dairy has a large share in making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on stock and their \u201ckeep\u201d\u2014an exercise which strengthens her understanding so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most other subjects.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was not a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but no temptation would have induced him to carry on any field-work, however early in the morning, on a Sunday; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a pair of oxen \u201csweltered\u201d while he was ploughing on Good Friday?

Those who stayed at home were chiefly mothers, like Timothy\u2019s Bess, who stood at her own door nursing her baby and feeling as women feel in that position\u2014that nothing else can be expected of them. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It was not entirely to see Thias Bede\u2019s funeral that the people were standing about the churchyard so long before service began; that was their common practice. The women, indeed, usually entered the church at once, and the farmers\u2019 wives talked in an undertone to each other, over the tall pews, about their illnesses and the total failure of doctor\u2019s stuff, recommending dandelion-tea, and other home-made specifics, as far preferable\u2014about the servants, and their growing exorbitance as to wages, whereas the quality of their services declined from year to year, and there was no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you could see her\u2014about the bad price Mr. Dingall, the Treddleston grocer, was giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as to his solvency, notwithstanding that Mrs. Dingall was a sensible woman, and they were all sorry for ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her"),", for she had very good kin. Meantime the men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the singers, who had a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through, entered the church until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature entrance\u2014what could they do in church if they were there before service began?\u2014and they did not conceive that any power in the universe could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about \u201cbus\u2019ness.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry at him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at once as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with which the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the farmers; for Chad was accustomed to say that a working-man must hold a candle to a personage understood to be as black as he was himself on weekdays; by which evil-sounding rule of conduct he meant what was, after all, rather virtuous than otherwise, namely, that men who had horses to be shod must be treated with respect. Chad and the rougher sort of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the white thorn, where the burial was going forward; but Sandy Jim, and several of the farm-labourers, made a group round it, and stood with their hats off, as fellow-mourners with the mother and sons. Others held a midway position, sometimes watching the group at the grave, sometimes listening to the conversation of the farmers, who stood in a knot near the church door, and were now joined by Martin Poyser, while his family passed into the church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson, the landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking attitude\u2014that is to say, with the forefinger of his right hand thrust between the buttons of his waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches pocket, and his head very much on one side; looking, on the whole, like an actor who has only a mono-syllabic part entrusted to him, but feels sure that the audience discern his fitness for the leading business; curiously in contrast with old Jonathan Burge, who held his hands behind him and leaned forward, coughing asthmatically, with an inward scorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash. The talk was in rather a lower tone than usual to-day, hushed a little by the sound of Mr. Irwine\u2019s voice reading the final prayers of the burial-service. They had all had their word of pity for poor Thias, but now they had got upon the nearer subject of their own grievances against Satchell, the Squire\u2019s bailiff, who played the part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr. Donnithorne himself, for that gentleman had the meanness to receive his own rents and make bargains about his own timber. This subject of conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door. And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine\u2019s voice had ceased, and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine passed. Adam and Seth were coming next, with their mother between them; for Joshua Rann officiated as head sexton as well as clerk, and was not yet ready to follow the rector into the vestry. But there was a pause before the three mourners came on: Lisbeth had turned round to look again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth under the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any day since her husband\u2019s death. Along with all her grief there was mixed an unusual sense of her own importance in having a \u201cburial,\u201d and in Mr. Irwine\u2019s reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods of their fellow-parishioners. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of Mr. Donnithorne\u2019s carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth; the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every one must now enter and take his place. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  I cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was remarkable for anything except for the grey age of its oaken pews\u2014great square pews mostly, ranged on each side of a narrow aisle. It was free, indeed, from the modern blemish of galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to themselves in the middle of the right-hand row, so that it was a short process for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass, and return to his desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk, grey and old as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into the chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne\u2019s family and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the buff-washed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior, and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats. And there were liberal touches of crimson toward the chancel, for the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne\u2019s own pew had handsome crimson cloth cushions; and, to close the vista, there was a crimson altar-cloth, embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia\u2019s own hand. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But even without the crimson cloth, the effect must have been warm and cheering when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking benignly round on that simple congregation\u2014on the hardy old men, with bent knees and shoulders, perhaps, but with vigour left for much hedge-clipping and thatching; on the tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of the stone-cutters and carpenters; on the half-dozen well-to-do farmers, with their apple-cheeked families; and on the clean old women, mostly farm-labourers\u2019 wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under their black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow, folded passively over their chests. For none of the old people held books\u2014why should they? Not one of them could read. But they knew a few \u201cgood words\u201d by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and bring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing up\u2014the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey pews, while good Bishop Ken\u2019s evening hymn was being sung to one of those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in his usual place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent too\u2014all the more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his bass notes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of severity into the glances he sent over his spectacles at the recusant Will Maskery. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  I beseech you to imagine Mr. Irwine looking round on this scene, in his ample white surplice that became him so well, with his powdered hair thrown back, his rich brown complexion, and his finely cut nostril and upper lip; for there was a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen countenance as there is in all human faces from which a generous soul beams out. And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through the old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue, that threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his family. And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white figure. But Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances\u2014she was absorbed in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church, for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate by this time. She had never seen him since she parted with him in the wood on Thursday evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things had gone on just the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that had happened then had brought no changes after them; they were already like a dream. When she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat so, she dared not look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she curtsied herself. That must be old Mr. Donnithorne\u2014he always came first, the wrinkled small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia was passing, and though Hetty liked so much to look at her fashionable little coal-scuttle bonnet, with the wreath of small roses round it, she didn\u2019t mind it to-day. But there were no more curtsies\u2014no, he was not come; she felt sure there was nothing else passing the pew door but the house-keeper\u2019s black bonnet and the lady\u2019s maid\u2019s beautiful straw hat that had once been Miss Lydia\u2019s, and then the powdered heads of the butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet she would look now\u2014she might be mistaken\u2014for, after all, she had not looked. So she lifted up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the chancel\u2014there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged prayer-book. The chill disappointment was too hard to bear. She felt herself turning pale, her lips trembling; she was ready to cry. Oh, what ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"should")," she do? Everybody would know the reason; they would know she was crying because Arthur was not there. And Mr. Craig, with the wonderful hothouse plant in his button-hole, was staring at her, she knew. It was dreadfully long before the General Confession began, so that she could kneel down. Two great drops ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"would")," fall then, but no one saw them except good-natured Molly, for her aunt and uncle knelt with their backs towards her. Molly, unable to imagine any cause for tears in church except faintness, of which she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew out of her pocket a queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after much labour in pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against Hetty\u2019s nostrils. \u201cIt donna smell,\u201d she whispered, thinking this was a great advantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good without biting your nose. Hetty pushed it away peevishly; but this little flash of temper did what the salts could not have done\u2014it roused her to wipe away the traces of her tears, and try with all her might not to shed any more. Hetty had a certain strength in her vain little nature: she would have borne anything rather than be laughed at, or pointed at with any other feeling than admiration; she would have pressed her own nails into her tender flesh rather than people should know a secret she did not want them to know. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  What fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings, while Mr. Irwine was pronouncing the solemn \u201cAbsolution\u201d in her deaf ears, and through all the tones of petition that followed! Anger lay very close to disappointment, and soon won the victory over the conjectures her small ingenuity could devise to account for Arthur\u2019s absence on the supposition that he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her again. And by the time she rose from her knees mechanically, because all the rest were rising, the colour had returned to her cheeks even with a heightened glow, for she was framing little indignant speeches to herself, saying she hated Arthur for giving her this pain\u2014she would like him to suffer too. Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so, as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But Adam\u2019s thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our moments of keen sensibility. And to Adam the church service was the best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to discern odours. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village nooks in the kingdom\u2014a reason of which I am sure you have not the slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses. The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance, like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the wind among the autumn boughs. This may seem a strange mode of speaking about the reading of a parish clerk\u2014a man in rusty spectacles, with stubbly hair, a large occiput, and a prominent crown. But that is Nature\u2019s way: she will allow a gentleman of splendid physiognomy and poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune, and not give him the slightest hint of it; and takes care that some narrow-browed fellow, trolling a ballad in the corner of a pot-house, shall be as true to his intervals as a bird. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Joshua himself was less proud of his reading than of his singing, and it was always with a sense of heightened importance that he passed from the desk to the choir. Still more to-day: it was a special occasion, for an old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death\u2014not in his bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant\u2014and now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure. Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua\u2019s importance in the choir suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang. The old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them, and the words\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThou sweep\u2019st us off as with a flood; We vanish hence like dreams\u201d\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor Thias. The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings. Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good; it was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a greater wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy days while he was living. The more there was said about her husband, the more there was done for him, surely the safer he would be. It was poor Lisbeth\u2019s blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of faith in some other love. Seth, who was easily touched, shed tears, and tried to recall, as he had done continually since his father\u2019s death, all that he had heard of the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last might be a moment of pardon and reconcilement; for was it not written in the very psalm they were singing that the Divine dealings were not measured and circumscribed by time? Adam had never been unable to join in a psalm before. He had known plenty of trouble and vexation since he had been a lad, but this was the first sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and strangely enough it was sorrow because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation was for ever gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his father\u2019s hand before their parting, and say, \u201cFather, you know it was all right between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!\u201d Adam thought but little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man\u2019s feelings had been in moments of humiliation, when he had held down his head before the rebukes of his son. When our indignation is borne in submissive silence, we are apt to feel twinges of doubt afterwards as to our own generosity, if not justice; how much more when the object of our anger has gone into everlasting silence, and we have seen his face for the last time in the meekness of death! "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh! I was always too hard,\u201d Adam said to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a sore fault in me as I\u2019m so hot and out o\u2019 patience with people when they do wrong, and my heart gets shut up against \u2019em, so as I can\u2019t bring myself to forgive \u2019em. I see clear enough there\u2019s more pride nor love in my soul, for I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th\u2019 hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind word to him. And there went plenty o\u2019 pride and temper to the strokes, as the devil ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"will")," be having his finger in what we call our duties as well as our sins. Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was easiest for myself. It\u2019s allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still, but the real tough job for me \u2019ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against my own pride. It seems to me now, if I was to find Father at home to-night, I should behave different; but there\u2019s no knowing\u2014perhaps nothing \u2019ud be a lesson to us if it didn\u2019t come too late. It\u2019s well we should feel as life\u2019s a reckoning we can\u2019t make twice over; there\u2019s no real making amends in this world, any more nor you can mend a wrong subtraction by doing your addition right.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  This was the key-note to which Adam\u2019s thoughts had perpetually returned since his father\u2019s death, and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger emphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference to Thias\u2019s funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, \u201cIn the midst of life we are in death\u201d\u2014how the present moment is all we can call our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family tenderness. All very old truths\u2014but what we thought the oldest truth becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men want to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light, do they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we may measure its intensity by remembering the former dimness? "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime words, \u201cThe peace of God, which passeth all understanding,\u201d seemed to blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the bonnets of the little maidens who had slept through the sermon, the fathers collecting the prayer-books, until all streamed out through the old archway into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk, their simple civilities, and their invitations to tea; for on a Sunday every one was ready to receive a guest\u2014it was the day when all must be in their best clothes and their best humour.

I hanna had a talk with you this long while, and the missis here wants you to see what can be done with her best spinning-wheel, for it\u2019s got broke, and it\u2019ll be a nice job to mend it\u2014there\u2019ll want a bit o\u2019 turning. You\u2019ll come as soon as you can now, will you?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr. Poyser paused and looked round while he was speaking, as if to see where Hetty was; for the children were running on before. Hetty was not without a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about her than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white hot-house plant, with a very long name\u2014a Scotch name, she supposed, since people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression on Hetty\u2019s face as she listened to the gardener\u2019s small talk. Yet in her secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information would be given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was very fond of giving information. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were received coldly, for to shift one\u2019s point of view beyond certain limits is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble understanding\u2014it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover, Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty that the \u201class was well enough,\u201d and that \u201ca man might do worse\u201d; but on convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who \u201cknew his business\u201d and who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he was less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said in confidence to her husband, \u201cYou\u2019re mighty fond o\u2019 Craig, but for my part, I think he\u2019s welly like a cock as thinks the sun\u2019s rose o\u2019 purpose to hear him crow.\u201d For the rest, Mr. Craig was an estimable gardener, and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of himself. He had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung his head forward a little, as he walked along with his hands in his breeches pockets. I think it was his pedigree only that had the advantage of being Scotch, and not his \u201cbringing up\u201d; for except that he had a stronger burr in his accent, his speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people about him. But a gardener is Scotch, as a French teacher is Parisian. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, Mr. Poyser,\u201d he said, before the good slow farmer had time to speak, \u201cye\u2019ll not be carrying your hay to-morrow, I\u2019m thinking. The glass sticks at \u2018change,\u2019 and ye may rely upo\u2019 my word as we\u2019ll ha\u2019 more downfall afore twenty-four hours is past.

It\u2019s a great thing to ha\u2019 studied the look o\u2019 the clouds. Lord bless you! Th\u2019 met\u2019orological almanecks can learn me nothing, but there\u2019s a pretty sight o\u2019 things I could let ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"them")," up to, if they\u2019d just come to me. And how are ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you"),", Mrs. Poyser?\u2014thinking o\u2019 getherin\u2019 the red currants soon, I reckon. You\u2019d a deal better gether \u2019em afore they\u2019re o\u2019erripe, wi\u2019 such weather as we\u2019ve got to look forward to. How do ye do, Mistress Bede?\u201d Mr. Craig continued, without a pause, nodding by the way to Adam and Seth. \u201cI hope y\u2019 enjoyed them spinach and gooseberries as I sent Chester with th\u2019 other day. If ye want vegetables while ye\u2019re in trouble, ye know where to come to. It\u2019s well known I\u2019m not giving other folks\u2019 things away, for when I\u2019ve supplied the house, the garden\u2019s my own spekilation, and it isna every man th\u2019 old squire could get as \u2019ud be equil to the undertaking, let alone asking whether he\u2019d be willing I\u2019ve got to run my calkilation fine, I can tell you, to make sure o\u2019 getting back the money as I pay the squire. I should like to see some o\u2019 them fellows as make the almanecks looking as far before their noses as I\u2019ve got to do every year as comes.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThey look pretty fur, though,\u201d said Mr. Poyser, turning his head on one side and speaking in rather a subdued reverential tone. \u201cWhy, what could come truer nor that pictur o\u2019 the cock wi\u2019 the big spurs, as has got its head knocked down wi\u2019 th\u2019 anchor, an\u2019 th\u2019 firin\u2019, an\u2019 the ships behind? Why, that pictur was made afore Christmas, and yit it\u2019s come as true as th\u2019 Bible. Why, th\u2019 cock\u2019s France, an\u2019 th\u2019 anchor\u2019s Nelson\u2014an\u2019 they told us that beforehand.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cPee\u2014ee-eh!\u201d said Mr. Craig. \u201cA man doesna want to see fur to know as th\u2019 English \u2019ull beat the French. Why, I know upo\u2019 good authority as it\u2019s a big Frenchman as reaches five foot high, an\u2019 they live upo\u2019 spoon-meat mostly. I knew a man as his father had a particular knowledge o\u2019 the French. I should like to know what them grasshoppers are to do against such fine fellows as our young Captain Arthur. Why, it \u2019ud astonish a Frenchman only to look at him; his arm\u2019s thicker nor a Frenchman\u2019s body, I\u2019ll be bound, for they pinch theirsells in wi\u2019 stays; and it\u2019s easy enough, for they\u2019ve got nothing i\u2019 their insides.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhere is the captain, as he wasna at church to-day?\u201d said Adam. \u201cI was talking to him o\u2019 Friday, and he said nothing about his going away.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, he\u2019s only gone to Eagledale for a bit o\u2019 fishing; I reckon he\u2019ll be back again afore many days are o\u2019er, for he\u2019s to be at all th\u2019 arranging and preparing o\u2019 things for the comin\u2019 o\u2019 age o\u2019 the 30th o\u2019 July.

Him and th\u2019 old squire fit one another like frost and flowers.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation, but the subject was not developed farther, for now they had reached the turning in the road where Adam and his companions must say \u201cgood-bye.\u201d The gardener, too, would have had to turn off in the same direction if he had not accepted Mr. Poyser\u2019s invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly seconded the invitation, for she would have held it a deep disgrace not to make her neighbours welcome to her house: personal likes and dislikes must not interfere with that sacred custom. Moreover, Mr. Craig had always been full of civilities to the family at the Hall Farm, and Mrs. Poyser was scrupulous in declaring that she had \u201cnothing to say again\u2019 him, on\u2019y it was a pity he couldna be hatched o\u2019er again, an\u2019 hatched different.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  So Adam and Seth, with their mother between them, wound their way down to the valley and up again to the old house, where a saddened memory had taken the place of a long, long anxiety\u2014where Adam would never have to ask again as he entered, \u201cWhere\u2019s Father?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  And the other family party, with Mr. Craig for company, went back to the pleasant bright house-place at the Hall Farm\u2014all with quiet minds, except Hetty, who knew now where Arthur was gone, but was only the more puzzled and uneasy. For it appeared that his absence was quite voluntary; he need not have gone\u2014he would not have gone if he had wanted to see her. She had a sickening sense that no lot could ever be pleasant to her again if her Thursday night\u2019s vision was not to be fulfilled; and in this moment of chill, bare, wintry disappointment and doubt, she looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again, of meeting his loving glance, and hearing his soft words with that eager yearning which one may call the \u201cgrowing pain\u201d of passion."))}w.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

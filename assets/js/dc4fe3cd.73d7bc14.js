There were other people in the two parishes who derived dignity from their functions rather than from their pocket, and of these Bartle Massey was one. His lame walk was rather slower than usual on this warm day, so Adam lingered behind when the bell rang for dinner, that he might walk up with his old friend; for he was a little too shy to join the Poyser party on this public occasion. Opportunities of getting to Hetty\u2019s side would be sure to turn up in the course of the day, and Adam contented himself with that for he disliked any risk of being \u201cjoked\u201d about Hetty\u2014the big, outspoken, fearless man was very shy and diffident as to his love-making.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt stands to sense,\u201d Mr. Casson was saying, \u201cas old Mr. Poyser, as is th\u2019 oldest man i\u2019 the room, should sit at top o\u2019 the table.

Mr. Casson, however, did not feel it compatible with his dignity and superior knowledge to join in the laugh, until it turned out that he was fixed on as the second broadest man. Martin Poyser the younger, as the broadest, was to be president, and Mr. Casson, as next broadest, was to be vice. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Owing to this arrangement, Adam, being, of course, at the bottom of the table, fell under the immediate observation of Mr. Casson, who, too much occupied with the question of precedence, had not hitherto noticed his entrance. Mr. Casson, we have seen, considered Adam \u201crather lifted up and peppery-like\u201d: he thought the gentry made more fuss about this young carpenter than was necessary; they made no fuss about Mr. Casson, although he had been an excellent butler for fifteen years. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, Mr. Bede, you\u2019re one o\u2019 them as mounts hup\u2019ards apace,\u201d he said, when Adam sat down. \u201cYou\u2019ve niver dined here before, as I remember.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, Mr. Casson,\u201d said Adam, in his strong voice, that could be heard along the table; \u201cI\u2019ve never dined here before, but I come by Captain Donnithorne\u2019s wish, and I hope it\u2019s not disagreeable to anybody here.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, nay,\u201d said several voices at once, \u201cwe\u2019re glad ye\u2019re come.

A man that\u2019s got the names and the natur o\u2019 plants in\u2019s head isna likely to keep a hollow place t\u2019 hold tunes in.

He\u2019d got nothing else to think on.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThe Scotch tunes!\u201d said Bartle Massey, contemptuously; \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough o\u2019 the Scotch tunes to last me while I live. They\u2019re fit for nothing but to frighten the birds with\u2014that\u2019s to say, the English birds, for the Scotch birds may sing Scotch for what I know.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, the Scotch tunes are just like a scolding, nagging woman,\u201d Bartle went on, without deigning to notice Mr. Craig\u2019s remark. \u201cThey go on with the same thing over and over again, and never come to a reasonable end. Anybody \u2019ud think the Scotch tunes had always been asking a question of somebody as deaf as old Taft, and had never got an answer yet.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam minded the less about sitting by Mr. Casson, because this position enabled him to see Hetty, who was not far off him at the next table. Hetty, however, had not even noticed his presence yet, for she was giving angry attention to Totty, who insisted on drawing up her feet on to the bench in antique fashion, and thereby threatened to make dusty marks on Hetty\u2019s pink-and-white frock. No sooner were the little fat legs pushed down than up they came again, for Totty\u2019s eyes were too busy in staring at the large dishes to see where the plum pudding was for her to retain any consciousness of her legs. Hetty got quite out of patience, and at last, with a frown and pout, and gathering tears, she said, \u201cOh dear, Aunt, I wish you\u2019d speak to Totty; she keeps putting her legs up so, and messing my frock.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter wi\u2019 the child? She can niver please you,\u201d said the mother. \u201cLet her come by the side o\u2019 me, then. ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I")," can put up wi\u2019 her.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam was looking at Hetty, and saw the frown, and pout, and the dark eyes seeming to grow larger with pettish half-gathered tears. Quiet Mary Burge, who sat near enough to see that Hetty was cross and that Adam\u2019s eyes were fixed on her, thought that so sensible a man as Adam must be reflecting on the small value of beauty in a woman whose temper was bad. Mary was a good girl, not given to indulge in evil feelings, but she said to herself, that, since Hetty had a bad temper, it was better Adam should know it. And it was quite true that if Hetty had been plain, she would have looked very ugly and unamiable at that moment, and no one\u2019s moral judgment upon her would have been in the least beguiled. But really there was something quite charming in her pettishness: it looked so much more like innocent distress than ill humour; and the severe Adam felt no movement of disapprobation; he only felt a sort of amused pity, as if he had seen a kitten setting up its back, or a little bird with its feathers ruffled. He could not gather what was vexing her, but it was impossible to him to feel otherwise than that she was the prettiest thing in the world, and that if he could have his way, nothing should ever vex her any more. And presently, when Totty was gone, she caught his eye, and her face broke into one of its brightest smiles, as she nodded to him. It was a bit of flirtation\u2014she knew Mary Burge was looking at them. But the smile was like wine to Adam."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

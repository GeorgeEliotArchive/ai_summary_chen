It was easy for her to fill her mornings apart from Lucy without any obvious effort; for she had her promised visits to pay to her aunt Glegg, and it was natural that she should give her mother more than usual of her companionship in these last weeks, especially as there were preparations to be thought of for Tom\u2019s housekeeping. But Lucy would hear of no pretext for her remaining away in the evenings; she must always come from aunt Glegg\u2019s before dinner,\u2014\u201celse what shall I have of you?\u201d said Lucy, with a tearful pout that could not be resisted. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  And Mr Stephen Guest had unaccountably taken to dining at Mr Deane\u2019s as often as possible, instead of avoiding that, as he used to do. At first he began his mornings with a resolution that he would not dine there, not even go in the evening, till Maggie was away. He had even devised a plan of starting off on a journey in this agreeable June weather; the headaches which he had constantly been alleging as a ground for stupidity and silence were a sufficient ostensible motive. But the journey was not taken, and by the fourth morning no distinct resolution was formed about the evenings; they were only foreseen as times when Maggie would still be present for a little while,\u2014when one more touch, one more glance, might be snatched. For why not? There was nothing to conceal between them; they knew, they had confessed their love, and they had renounced each other; they were going to part. Honour and conscience were going to divide them; Maggie, with that appeal from her inmost soul, had decided it; but surely they might cast a lingering look at each other across the gulf, before they turned away never to look again till that strange light had forever faded out of their eyes. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie, all this time, moved about with a quiescence and even torpor of manner, so contrasted with her usual fitful brightness and ardor, that Lucy would have had to seek some other cause for such a change, if she had not been convinced that the position in which Maggie stood between Philip and her brother, and the prospect of her self-imposed wearisome banishment, were quite enough to account for a large amount of depression. But under this torpor there was a fierce battle of emotions, such as Maggie in all her life of struggle had never known or foreboded; it seemed to her as if all the worst evil in her had lain in ambush till now, and had suddenly started up full-armed, with hideous, overpowering strength! There were moments in which a cruel selfishness seemed to be getting possession of her; why should not Lucy, why should not Philip, suffer? ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"She")," had had to suffer through many years of her life; and who had renounced anything for her? And when something like that fulness of existence\u2014love, wealth, ease, refinement, all that her nature craved\u2014was brought within her reach, why was she to forego it, that another might have it,\u2014another, who perhaps needed it less? But amidst all this new passionate tumult there were the old voices making themselves heard with rising power, till, from time to time, the tumult seemed quelled. ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Was")," that existence which tempted her the full existence she dreamed? Where, then, would be all the memories of early striving; all the deep pity for another\u2019s pain, which had been nurtured in her through years of affection and hardship; all the divine presentiment of something higher than mere personal enjoyment, which had made the sacredness of life? She might as well hope to enjoy walking by maiming her feet, as hope to enjoy an existence in which she set out by maiming the faith and sympathy that were the best organs of her soul. And then, if pain were so hard to ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her"),", what was it to others? \u201cAh, God! preserve me from inflicting\u2014give me strength to bear it.\u201d How had she sunk into this struggle with a temptation that she would once have thought herself as secure from as from deliberate crime? When was that first hateful moment in which she had been conscious of a feeling that clashed with her truth, affection, and gratitude, and had not shaken it from her with horror, as if it had been a loathsome thing? And yet, since this strange, sweet, subduing influence did not, should not, conquer her,\u2014since it was to remain simply her own suffering,\u2014her mind was meeting Stephen\u2019s in that thought of his, that they might still snatch moments of mute confession before the parting came. For was not he suffering too? She saw it daily\u2014saw it in the sickened look of fatigue with which, as soon as he was not compelled to exert himself, he relapsed into indifference toward everything but the possibility of watching her. Could she refuse sometimes to answer that beseeching look which she felt to be following her like a low murmur of love and pain? She refused it less and less, till at last the evening for them both was sometimes made of a moment\u2019s mutual gaze; they thought of it till it came, and when it had come, they thought of nothing else. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  One other thing Stephen seemed now and then to care for, and that was to sing; it was a way of speaking to Maggie. Perhaps he was not distinctly conscious that he was impelled to it by a secret longing\u2014running counter to all his self-confessed resolves\u2014to deepen the hold he had on her. Watch your own speech, and notice how it is guided by your less conscious purposes, and you will understand that contradiction in Stephen. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Philip Wakem was a less frequent visitor, but he came occasionally in the evening, and it happened that he was there when Lucy said, as they sat out on the lawn, near sunset,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow Maggie\u2019s tale of visits to aunt Glegg is completed, I mean that we shall go out boating every day until she goes.

Philip coloured too, but less from a feeling of personal offence than from a vague suspicion that Stephen\u2019s moodiness had some relation to Maggie, who had started up from her chair as he spoke, and had walked toward the hedge of laurels to look at the descending sunlight on the river. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAs Miss Deane didn\u2019t know she was excluding others by inviting me,\u201d said Philip, \u201cI am bound to resign.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, indeed, you shall not,\u201d said Lucy, much vexed. \u201cI particularly wish for your company to-morrow. The tide will suit at half-past ten; it will be a delicious time for a couple of hours to row to Luckreth and walk back, before the sun gets too hot. And how can you object to four people in a boat?\u201d she added, looking at Stephen. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI don\u2019t object to the people, but the number,\u201d said Stephen, who had recovered himself, and was rather ashamed of his rudeness. \u201cIf I voted for a fourth at all, of course it would be you, Phil. But we won\u2019t divide the pleasure of escorting the ladies; we\u2019ll take it alternately. I\u2019ll go the next day.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  This incident had the effect of drawing Philip\u2019s attention with freshened solicitude toward Stephen and Maggie; but when they re-entered the house, music was proposed, and Mrs Tulliver and Mr Deane being occupied with cribbage, Maggie sat apart near the table where the books and work were placed, doing nothing, however, but listening abstractedly to the music. Stephen presently turned to a duet which he insisted that Lucy and Philip should sing; he had often done the same thing before; but this evening Philip thought he divined some double intention in every word and look of Stephen\u2019s, and watched him keenly, angry with himself all the while for this clinging suspicion. For had not Maggie virtually denied any ground for his doubts on her side? And she was truth itself; it was impossible not to believe her word and glance when they had last spoken together in the garden. Stephen might be strongly fascinated by her (what was more natural?), but Philip felt himself rather base for intruding on what must be his friend\u2019s painful secret. Still he watched. Stephen, moving away from the piano, sauntered slowly toward the table near which Maggie sat, and turned over the newspapers, apparently in mere idleness. Then he seated himself with his back to the piano, dragging a newspaper under his elbow, and thrusting his hand through his hair, as if he had been attracted by some bit of local news in the \u201cLaceham Courier.\u201d He was in reality looking at Maggie who had not taken the slightest notice of his approach. She had always additional strength of resistance when Philip was present, just as we can restrain our speech better in a spot that we feel to be hallowed. But at last she heard the word \u201cdearest\u201d uttered in the softest tone of pained entreaty, like that of a patient who asks for something that ought to have been given without asking. She had never heard that word since the moments in the lane at Basset, when it had come from Stephen again and again, almost as involuntarily as if it had been an inarticulate cry. Philip could hear no word, but he had moved to the opposite side of the piano, and could see Maggie start and blush, raise her eyes an instant toward Stephen\u2019s face, but immediately look apprehensively toward himself. It was not evident to her that Philip had observed her; but a pang of shame, under the sense of this concealment, made her move from her chair and walk to her mother\u2019s side to watch the game at cribbage. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Philip went home soon after in a state of hideous doubt mingled with wretched certainty. It was impossible for him now to resist the conviction that there was some mutual consciousness between Stephen and Maggie; and for half the night his irritable, susceptible nerves were pressed upon almost to frenzy by that one wretched fact; he could attempt no explanation that would reconcile it with her words and actions. When, at last, the need for belief in Maggie rose to its habitual predominance, he was not long in imagining the truth,\u2014she was struggling, she was banishing herself; this was the clue to all he had seen since his return. But athwart that belief there came other possibilities that would not be driven out of sight. His imagination wrought out the whole story; Stephen was madly in love with her; he must have told her so; she had rejected him, and was hurrying away. But would he give her up, knowing\u2014Philip felt the fact with heart-crushing despair\u2014that she was made half helpless by her feeling toward him? "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  When the morning came, Philip was too ill to think of keeping his engagement to go in the boat. In his present agitation he could decide on nothing; he could only alternate between contradictory intentions. First, he thought he must have an interview with Maggie, and entreat her to confide in him; then, again, he distrusted his own interference. Had he not been thrusting himself on Maggie all along? She had uttered words long ago in her young ignorance; it was enough to make her hate him that these should be continually present with her as a bond. And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him? He would not trust himself to see her, till he had assured himself that he could act from pure anxiety for her, and not from egoistic irritation. He wrote a brief note to Stephen, and sent it early by the servant, saying that he was not well enough to fulfil his engagement to Miss Deane. Would Stephen take his excuse, and fill his place? "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Lucy had arranged a charming plan, which had made her quite content with Stephen\u2019s refusal to go in the boat. She discovered that her father was to drive to Lindum this morning at ten; Lindum was the very place she wanted to go to, to make purchases,\u2014important purchases, which must by no means be put off to another opportunity; and aunt Tulliver must go too, because she was concerned in some of the purchases. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou will have your row in the boat just the same, you know,\u201d she said to Maggie when they went out of the breakfast-room and upstairs together; \u201cPhilip will be here at half-past ten, and it is a delicious morning. Now don\u2019t say a word against it, you dear dolorous thing. What is the use of my being a fairy godmother, if you set your face against all the wonders I work for you? Don\u2019t think of awful cousin Tom; you may disobey him a little.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie did not persist in objecting. She was almost glad of the plan, for perhaps it would bring her some strength and calmness to be alone with Philip again; it was like revisiting the scene of a quieter life, in which the very struggles were repose, compared with the daily tumult of the present. She prepared herself for the boat and at half-past ten sat waiting in the drawing-room. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The ring of the door-bell was punctual, and she was thinking with half-sad, affectionate pleasure of the surprise Philip would have in finding that he was to be with her alone, when she distinguished a firm, rapid step across the hall, that was certainly not Philip\u2019s; the door opened, and Stephen Guest entered. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  In the first moment they were both too much agitated to speak; for Stephen had learned from the servant that the others were gone out. Maggie had started up and sat down again, with her heart beating violently; and Stephen, throwing down his cap and gloves, came and sat by her in silence. She thought Philip would be coming soon; and with great effort\u2014for she trembled visibly\u2014she rose to go to a distant chair. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHe is not coming,\u201d said Stephen, in a low tone. \u201cI am going in the boat.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, we can\u2019t go,\u201d said Maggie, sinking into her chair again. \u201cLucy did not expect\u2014she would be hurt. Why is not Philip come?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHe is not well; he asked me to come instead.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLucy is gone to Lindum,\u201d said Maggie, taking off her bonnet with hurried, trembling fingers. \u201cWe must not go.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cVery well,\u201d said Stephen, dreamily, looking at her, as he rested his arm on the back of his chair. \u201cThen we\u2019ll stay here.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He was looking into her deep, deep eyes, far off and mysterious at the starlit blackness, and yet very near, and timidly loving. Maggie sat perfectly still\u2014perhaps for moments, perhaps for minutes\u2014until the helpless trembling had ceased, and there was a warm glow on her check. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThe man is waiting; he has taken the cushions,\u201d she said. \u201cWill you go and tell him?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat shall I tell him?\u201d said Stephen, almost in a whisper. He was looking at the lips now. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie made no answer. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet us go,\u201d Stephen murmured entreatingly, rising, and taking her hand to raise her too. \u201cWe shall not be long together.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  And they went. Maggie felt that she was being led down the garden among the roses, being helped with firm, tender care into the boat, having the cushion and cloak arranged for her feet, and her parasol opened for her (which she had forgotten), all by this stronger presence that seemed to bear her along without any act of her own will, like the added self which comes with the sudden exalting influence of a strong tonic, and she felt nothing else. Memory was excluded. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  They glided rapidly along, Stephen rowing, helped by the backward-flowing tide, past the Tofton trees and houses; on between the silent sunny fields and pastures, which seemed filled with a natural joy that had no reproach for theirs. The breath of the young, unwearied day, the delicious rhythmic dip of the oars, the fragmentary song of a passing bird heard now and then, as if it were only the overflowing of brimful gladness, the sweet solitude of a twofold consciousness that was mingled into one by that grave, untiring gaze which need not be averted,\u2014what else could there be in their minds for the first hour? Some low, subdued, languid exclamation of love came from Stephen from time to time, as he went on rowing idly, half automatically; otherwise they spoke no word; for what could words have been but an inlet to thought? and thought did not belong to that enchanted haze in which they were enveloped,\u2014it belonged to the past and the future that lay outside the haze. Maggie was only dimly conscious of the banks, as they passed them, and dwelt with no recognition on the villages; she knew there were several to be passed before they reached Luckreth, where they always stopped and left the boat. At all times she was so liable to fits of absence, that she was likely enough to let her waymarks pass unnoticed. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  But at last Stephen, who had been rowing more and more idly, ceased to row, laid down the oars, folded his arms, and looked down on the water as if watching the pace at which the boat glided without his help. This sudden change roused Maggie. She looked at the far-stretching fields, at the banks close by, and felt that they were entirely strange to her. A terrible alarm took possession of her. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, have we passed Luckreth, where we were to stop?\u201d she exclaimed, looking back to see if the place were out of sight. No village was to be seen. She turned around again, with a look of distressed questioning at Stephen. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He went on watching the water, and said, in a strange, dreamy, absent tone, \u201cYes, a long way.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, what shall I do?\u201d cried Maggie, in an agony. \u201cWe shall not get home for hours, and Lucy? O God, help me!\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  She clasped her hands and broke into a sob, like a frightened child; she thought of nothing but of meeting Lucy, and seeing her look of pained surprise and doubt, perhaps of just upbraiding. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Stephen moved and sat near her, and gently drew down the clasped hands. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMaggie,\u201d he said, in a deep tone of slow decision, \u201clet us never go home again, till no one can part us,\u2014till we are married.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The unusual tone, the startling words, arrested Maggie\u2019s sob, and she sat quite still, wondering; as if Stephen might have seen some possibilities that would alter everything, and annul the wretched facts. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSee, Maggie, how everything has come without our seeking,\u2014in spite of all our efforts. We never thought of being alone together again; it has all been done by others. See how the tide is carrying us out, away from all those unnatural bonds that we have been trying to make faster round us, and trying in vain. It will carry us on to Torby, and we can land there, and get some carriage, and hurry on to York and then to Scotland,\u2014and never pause a moment till we are bound to each other, so that only death can part us. It is the only right thing, dearest; it is the only way of escaping from this wretched entanglement. Everything has concurred to point it out to us. We have contrived nothing, we have thought of nothing ourselves.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Stephen spoke with deep, earnest pleading. Maggie listened, passing from her startled wonderment to the yearning after that belief that the tide was doing it all, that she might glide along with the swift, silent stream, and not struggle any more. But across that stealing influence came the terrible shadow of past thoughts; and the sudden horror lest now, at last, the moment of fatal intoxication was close upon her, called up feelings of angry resistance toward Stephen. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet me go!\u201d she said, in an agitated tone, flashing an indignant look at him, and trying to get her hands free. \u201cYou have wanted to deprive me of any choice. You knew we were come too far; you have dared to take advantage of my thoughtlessness. It is unmanly to bring me into such a position.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Stung by this reproach, he released her hands, moved back to his former place, and folded his arms, in a sort of desperation at the difficulty Maggie\u2019s words had made present to him. If she would not consent to go on, he must curse himself for the embarrassment he had led her into. But the reproach was the unendurable thing; the one thing worse than parting with her was, that she should feel he had acted unworthily toward her. At last he said, in a tone of suppressed rage,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI didn\u2019t notice that we had passed Luckreth till we had got to the next village; and then it came into my mind that we would go on. I can\u2019t justify it; I ought to have told you. It is enough to make you hate me, since you don\u2019t love me well enough to make everything else indifferent to you, as I do you. Shall I stop the boat and try to get you out here? I\u2019ll tell Lucy that I was mad, and that you hate me; and you shall be clear of me forever. No one can blame you, because I have behaved unpardonably to you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie was paralyzed; it was easier to resist Stephen\u2019s pleading than this picture he had called up of himself suffering while she was vindicated; easier even to turn away from his look of tenderness than from this look of angry misery, that seemed to place her in selfish isolation from him. He had called up a state of feeling in which the reasons which had acted on her conscience seemed to be transmitted into mere self-regard. The indignant fire in her eyes was quenched, and she began to look at him with timid distress. She had reproached him for being hurried into irrevocable trespass,\u2014she, who had been so weak herself. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAs if I shouldn\u2019t feel what happened to you\u2014just the same,\u201d she said, with reproach of another kind,\u2014the reproach of love, asking for more trust. This yielding to the idea of Stephen\u2019s suffering was more fatal than the other yielding, because it was less distinguishable from that sense of others\u2019 claims which was the moral basis of her resistance. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He felt all the relenting in her look and tone; it was heaven opening again. He moved to her side, and took her hand, leaning his elbow on the back of the boat, and saying nothing. He dreaded to utter another word, he dreaded to make another movement, that might provoke another reproach or denial from her. Life hung on her consent; everything else was hopeless, confused, sickening misery. They glided along in this way, both resting in that silence as in a haven, both dreading lest their feelings should be divided again,\u2014till they became aware that the clouds had gathered, and that the slightest perceptible freshening of the breeze was growing and growing, so that the whole character of the day was altered. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou will be chill, Maggie, in this thin dress. Let me raise the cloak over your shoulders. Get up an instant, dearest.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie obeyed; there was an unspeakable charm in being told what to do, and having everything decided for her. She sat down again covered with the cloak, and Stephen took to his oars again, making haste; for they must try to get to Torby as fast as they could. Maggie was hardly conscious of having said or done anything decisive. All yielding is attended with a less vivid consciousness than resistance; it is the partial sleep of thought; it is the submergence of our own personality by another. Every influence tended to lull her into acquiescence. That dreamy gliding in the boat which had lasted for four hours, and had brought some weariness and exhaustion; the recoil of her fatigued sensations from the impracticable difficulty of getting out of the boat at this unknown distance from home, and walking for long miles,\u2014all helped to bring her into more complete subjection to that strong, mysterious charm which made a last parting from Stephen seem the death of all joy, and made the thought of wounding him like the first touch of the torturing iron before which resolution shrank. And then there was the present happiness of being with him, which was enough to absorb all her languid energy. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Presently Stephen observed a vessel coming after them. Several vessels, among them the steamer to Mudport, had passed them with the early tide, but for the last hour they had seen none. He looked more and more eagerly at this vessel, as if a new thought had come into his mind along with it, and then he looked at Maggie hesitatingly. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMaggie, dearest,\u201d he said at last, \u201cif this vessel should be going to Mudport, or to any convenient place on the coast northward, it would be our best plan to get them to take us on board. You are fatigued, and it may soon rain; it may be a wretched business, getting to Torby in this boat. It\u2019s only a trading vessel, but I dare say you can be made tolerably comfortable. We\u2019ll take the cushions out of the boat. It is really our best plan. They\u2019ll be glad enough to take us. I\u2019ve got plenty of money about me. I can pay them well.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie\u2019s heart began to beat with reawakened alarm at this new proposition; but she was silent,\u2014one course seemed as difficult as another. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Stephen hailed the vessel. It was a Dutch vessel going to Mudport, the English mate informed him, and, if this wind held, would be there in less than two days. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWe had got out too far with our boat,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cI was trying to make for Torby. But I\u2019m afraid of the weather; and this lady\u2014my wife\u2014will be exhausted with fatigue and hunger. Take us on board\u2014will you?\u2014and haul up the boat. I\u2019ll pay you well.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie, now really faint and trembling with fear, was taken on board, making an interesting object of contemplation to admiring Dutchmen. The mate feared the lady would have a poor time of it on board, for they had no accommodation for such entirely unlooked-for passengers,\u2014no private cabin larger than an old-fashioned church-pew. But at least they had Dutch cleanliness, which makes all other inconveniences tolerable; and the boat cushions were spread into a couch for Maggie on the poop with all alacrity. But to pace up and down the deck leaning on Stephen\u2014being upheld by his strength\u2014was the first change that she needed; then came food, and then quiet reclining on the cushions, with the sense that no new resolution ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"could")," be taken that day. Everything must wait till to-morrow. Stephen sat beside her with her hand in his; they could only speak to each other in low tones; only look at each other now and then, for it would take a long while to dull the curiosity of the five men on board, and reduce these handsome young strangers to that minor degree of interest which belongs, in a sailor\u2019s regard, to all objects nearer than the horizon. But Stephen was triumphantly happy. Every other thought or care was thrown into unmarked perspective by the certainty that Maggie must be his. The leap had been taken now; he had been tortured by scruples, he had fought fiercely with overmastering inclination, he had hesitated; but repentance was impossible. He murmured forth in fragmentary sentences his happiness, his adoration, his tenderness, his belief that their life together must be heaven, that her presence with him would give rapture to every common day; that to satisfy her lightest wish was dearer to him than all other bliss; that everything was easy for her sake, except to part with her; and now they never ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"would")," part; he would belong to her forever, and all that was his was hers,\u2014had no value for him except as it was hers. Such things, uttered in low, broken tones by the one voice that has first stirred the fibre of young passion, have only a feeble effect\u2014on experienced minds at a distance from them. To poor Maggie they were very near; they were like nectar held close to thirsty lips; there was, there ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"must")," be, then, a life for mortals here below which was not hard and chill,\u2014in which affection would no longer be self-sacrifice. Stephen\u2019s passionate words made the vision of such a life more fully present to her than it had ever been before; and the vision for the time excluded all realities,\u2014all except the returning sun-gleams which broke out on the waters as the evening approached, and mingled with the visionary sunlight of promised happiness; all except the hand that pressed hers, and the voice that spoke to her, and the eyes that looked at her with grave, unspeakable love. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  There was to be no rain, after all; the clouds rolled off to the horizon again, making the great purple rampart and long purple isles of that wondrous land which reveals itself to us when the sun goes down,\u2014the land that the evening star watches over. Maggie was to sleep all night on the poop; it was better than going below; and she was covered with the warmest wrappings the ship could furnish. It was still early, when the fatigues of the day brought on a drowsy longing for perfect rest, and she laid down her head, looking at the faint, dying flush in the west, where the one golden lamp was getting brighter and brighter. Then she looked up at Stephen, who was still seated by her, hanging over her as he leaned his arm against the vessel\u2019s side. Behind all the delicious visions of these last hours, which had flowed over her like a soft stream, and made her entirely passive, there was the dim consciousness that the condition was a transient one, and that the morrow must bring back the old life of struggle; that there were thoughts which would presently avenge themselves for this oblivion. But now nothing was distinct to her; she was being lulled to sleep with that soft stream still flowing over her, with those delicious visions melting and fading like the wondrous aerial land of the west. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Chapter XIV. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Waking "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  When Maggie was gone to sleep, Stephen, weary too with his unaccustomed amount of rowing, and with the intense inward life of the last twelve hours, but too restless to sleep, walked and lounged about the deck with his cigar far on into midnight, not seeing the dark water, hardly conscious there were stars, living only in the near and distant future. At last fatigue conquered restlessness, and he rolled himself up in a piece of tarpaulin on the deck near Maggie\u2019s feet. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  She had fallen asleep before nine, and had been sleeping for six hours before the faintest hint of a midsummer daybreak was discernible. She awoke from that vivid dreaming which makes the margin of our deeper rest. She was in a boat on the wide water with Stephen, and in the gathering darkness something like a star appeared, that grew and grew till they saw it was the Virgin seated in St Ogg\u2019s boat, and it came nearer and nearer, till they saw the Virgin was Lucy and the boatman was Philip,\u2014no, not Philip, but her brother, who rowed past without looking at her; and she rose to stretch out her arms and call to him, and their own boat turned over with the movement, and they began to sink, till with one spasm of dread she seemed to awake, and find she was a child again in the parlour at evening twilight, and Tom was not really angry. From the soothed sense of that false waking she passed to the real waking,\u2014to the plash of water against the vessel, and the sound of a footstep on the deck, and the awful starlit sky. There was a moment of utter bewilderment before her mind could get disentangled from the confused web of dreams; but soon the whole terrible truth urged itself upon her. Stephen was not by her now; she was alone with her own memory and her own dread. The irrevocable wrong that must blot her life had been committed; she had brought sorrow into the lives of others,\u2014into the lives that were knit up with hers by trust and love. The feeling of a few short weeks had hurried her into the sins her nature had most recoiled from,\u2014breach of faith and cruel selfishness; she had rent the ties that had given meaning to duty, and had made herself an outlawed soul, with no guide but the wayward choice of her own passion. And where would that lead her? Where had it led her now? She had said she would rather die than fall into that temptation. She felt it now,\u2014now that the consequences of such a fall had come before the outward act was completed. There was at least this fruit from all her years of striving after the highest and best,\u2014that her soul though betrayed, beguiled, ensnared, could never deliberately consent to a choice of the lower. And a choice of what? O God! not a choice of joy, but of conscious cruelty and hardness; for could she ever cease to see before her Lucy and Philip, with their murdered trust and hopes? Her life with Stephen could have no sacredness; she must forever sink and wander vaguely, driven by uncertain impulse; for she had let go the clue of life,\u2014that clue which once in the far-off years her young need had clutched so strongly. She had renounced all delights then, before she knew them, before they had come within her reach. Philip had been right when he told her that she knew nothing of renunciation; she had thought it was quiet ecstasy; she saw it face to face now,\u2014that sad, patient, loving strength which holds the clue of life,\u2014and saw that the thorns were forever pressing on its brow. The yesterday, which could never be revoked,\u2014if she could have changed it now for any length of inward silent endurance, she would have bowed beneath that cross with a sense of rest. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Day break came and the reddening eastern light, while her past life was grasping her in this way, with that tightening clutch which comes in the last moments of possible rescue. She could see Stephen now lying on the deck still fast asleep, and with the sight of him there came a wave of anguish that found its way in a long-suppressed sob. The worst bitterness of parting\u2014the thought that urged the sharpest inward cry for help\u2014was the pain it must give to ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"him"),". But surmounting everything was the horror at her own possible failure, the dread lest her conscience should be benumbed again, and not rise to energy till it was too late. Too late! it was too late already not to have caused misery; too late for everything, perhaps, but to rush away from the last act of baseness,\u2014the tasting of joys that were wrung from crushed hearts. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The sun was rising now, and Maggie started up with the sense that a day of resistance was beginning for her. Her eyelashes were still wet with tears, as, with her shawl over her head, she sat looking at the slowly rounding sun. Something roused Stephen too, and getting up from his hard bed, he came to sit beside her. The sharp instinct of anxious love saw something to give him alarm in the very first glance. He had a hovering dread of some resistance in Maggie\u2019s nature that he would be unable to overcome. He had the uneasy consciousness that he had robbed her of perfect freedom yesterday; there was too much native honour in him, for him not to feel that, if her will should recoil, his conduct would have been odious, and she would have a right to reproach him. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  But Maggie did not feel that right; she was too conscious of fatal weakness in herself, too full of the tenderness that comes with the foreseen need for inflicting a wound. She let him take her hand when he came to sit down beside her, and smiled at him, only with rather a sad glance; she could say nothing to pain him till the moment of possible parting was nearer. And so they drank their cup of coffee together, and walked about the deck, and heard the captain\u2019s assurance that they should be in at Mudport by five o\u2019clock, each with an inward burthen; but in him it was an undefined fear, which he trusted to the coming hours to dissipate; in her it was a definite resolve on which she was trying silently to tighten her hold. Stephen was continually, through the morning, expressing his anxiety at the fatigue and discomfort she was suffering, and alluded to landing and to the change of motion and repose she would have in a carriage, wanting to assure himself more completely by presupposing that everything would be as he had arranged it. For a long while Maggie contented herself with assuring him that she had had a good night\u2019s rest, and that she didn\u2019t mind about being on the vessel,\u2014it was not like being on the open sea, it was only a little less pleasant than being in a boat on the Floss. But a suppressed resolve will betray itself in the eyes, and Stephen became more and more uneasy as the day advanced, under the sense that Maggie had entirely lost her passiveness. He longed, but did not dare, to speak of their marriage, of where they would go after it, and the steps he would take to inform his father, and the rest, of what had happened. He longed to assure himself of a tacit assent from her. But each time he looked at her, he gathered a stronger dread of the new, quiet sadness with which she met his eyes. And they were more and more silent. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHere we are in sight of Mudport,\u201d he said at last. \u201cNow, dearest,\u201d he added, turning toward her with a look that was half beseeching, \u201cthe worst part of your fatigue is over. On the land we can command swiftness. In another hour and a half we shall be in a chaise together, and that will seem rest to you after this.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie felt it was time to speak; it would only be unkind now to assent by silence. She spoke in the lowest tone, as he had done, but with distinct decision. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWe shall not be together; we shall have parted.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The blood rushed to Stephen\u2019s face. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWe shall not,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll die first.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It was as he had dreaded\u2014there was a struggle coming. But neither of them dared to say another word till the boat was let down, and they were taken to the landing-place. Here there was a cluster of gazers and passengers awaiting the departure of the steamboat to St Ogg\u2019s. Maggie had a dim sense, when she had landed, and Stephen was hurrying her along on his arm, that some one had advanced toward her from that cluster as if he were coming to speak to her. But she was hurried along, and was indifferent to everything but the coming trial. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  A porter guided them to the nearest inn and posting-house, and Stephen gave the order for the chaise as they passed through the yard. Maggie took no notice of this, and only said, \u201cAsk them to show us into a room where we can sit down.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  When they entered, Maggie did not sit down, and Stephen, whose face had a desperate determination in it, was about to ring the bell, when she said, in a firm voice,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m not going; we must part here.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMaggie,\u201d he said, turning round toward her, and speaking in the tones of a man who feels a process of torture beginning, \u201cdo you mean to kill me? What is the use of it now? The whole thing is done.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, it is not done,\u201d said Maggie. \u201cToo much is done,\u2014more than we can ever remove the trace of. But I will go no farther. Don\u2019t try to prevail with me again. I couldn\u2019t choose yesterday.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  What was he to do? He dared not go near her; her anger might leap out, and make a new barrier. He walked backward and forward in maddening perplexity. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMaggie,\u201d he said at last, pausing before her, and speaking in a tone of imploring wretchedness, \u201chave some pity\u2014hear me\u2014forgive me for what I did yesterday. I will obey you now; I will do nothing without your full consent. But don\u2019t blight our lives forever by a rash perversity that can answer no good purpose to any one, that can only create new evils. Sit down, dearest; wait\u2014think what you are going to do. Don\u2019t treat me as if you couldn\u2019t trust me.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He had chosen the most effective appeal; but Maggie\u2019s will was fixed unswervingly on the coming wrench. She had made up her mind to suffer. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWe must not wait,\u201d she said, in a low but distinct voice; \u201cwe must part at once.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWe ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"can\u2019t")," part, Maggie,\u201d said Stephen, more impetuously. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it. What is the use of inflicting that misery on me? The blow\u2014whatever it may have been\u2014has been struck now. Will it help any one else that you should drive me mad?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI will not begin any future, even for you,\u201d said Maggie, tremulously, \u201cwith a deliberate consent to what ought not to have been. What I told you at Basset I feel now; I would rather have died than fall into this temptation. It would have been better if we had parted forever then. But we must part now.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWe will ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"not")," part,\u201d Stephen burst out, instinctively placing his back against the door, forgetting everything he had said a few moments before; \u201cI will not endure it. You\u2019ll make me desperate; I sha\u2019n\u2019t know what I do.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie trembled. She felt that the parting could not be effected suddenly. She must rely on a slower appeal to Stephen\u2019s better self; she must be prepared for a harder task than that of rushing away while resolution was fresh. She sat down. Stephen, watching her with that look of desperation which had come over him like a lurid light, approached slowly from the door, seated himself close beside her, and grasped her hand. Her heart beat like the heart of a frightened bird; but this direct opposition helped her. She felt her determination growing stronger. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cRemember what you felt weeks ago,\u201d she began, with beseeching earnestness; \u201cremember what we both felt,\u2014that we owed ourselves to others, and must conquer every inclination which could make us false to that debt. We have failed to keep our resolutions; but the wrong remains the same.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, it does ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"not")," remain the same,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cWe have proved that it was impossible to keep our resolutions. We have proved that the feeling which draws us toward each other is too strong to be overcome. That natural law surmounts every other; we can\u2019t help what it clashes with.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt is not so, Stephen; I\u2019m quite sure that is wrong. I have tried to think it again and again; but I see, if we judged in that way, there would be a warrant for all treachery and cruelty; we should justify breaking the most sacred ties that can ever be formed on earth. If the past is not to bind us, where can duty lie? We should have no law but the inclination of the moment.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut there are ties that can\u2019t be kept by mere resolution,\u201d said Stephen, starting up and walking about again. \u201cWhat is outward faithfulness? Would they have thanked us for anything so hollow as constancy without love?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie did not answer immediately. She was undergoing an inward as well as an outward contest. At last she said, with a passionate assertion of her conviction, as much against herself as against him,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat seems right\u2014at first; but when I look further, I\u2019m sure it is ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"not")," right. Faithfulness and constancy mean something else besides doing what is easiest and pleasantest to ourselves. They mean renouncing whatever is opposed to the reliance others have in us,\u2014whatever would cause misery to those whom the course of our lives has made dependent on us. If we\u2014if I had been better, nobler, those claims would have been so strongly present with me,\u2014I should have felt them pressing on my heart so continually, just as they do now in the moments when my conscience is awake,\u2014that the opposite feeling would never have grown in me, as it has done; it would have been quenched at once, I should have prayed for help so earnestly, I should have rushed away as we rush from hideous danger. I feel no excuse for myself, none. I should never have failed toward Lucy and Philip as I have done, if I had not been weak, selfish, and hard,\u2014able to think of their pain without a pain to myself that would have destroyed all temptation. Oh, what is Lucy feeling now? She believed in me\u2014she loved me\u2014she was so good to me. Think of her\u2014\u2014\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie\u2019s voice was getting choked as she uttered these last words. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"can\u2019t")," think of her,\u201d said Stephen, stamping as if with pain. \u201cI can think of nothing but you, Maggie. You demand of a man what is impossible. I felt that once; but I can\u2019t go back to it now. And where is the use of ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"your")," thinking of it, except to torture me? You can\u2019t save them from pain now; you can only tear yourself from me, and make my life worthless to me. And even if we could go back, and both fulfil our engagements,\u2014if that were possible now,\u2014it would be hateful, horrible, to think of your ever being Philip\u2019s wife,\u2014of your ever being the wife of a man you didn\u2019t love. We have both been rescued from a mistake.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  A deep flush came over Maggie\u2019s face, and she couldn\u2019t speak. Stephen saw this. He sat down again, taking her hand in his, and looking at her with passionate entreaty. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMaggie! Dearest! If you love me, you are mine. Who can have so great a claim on you as I have? My life is bound up in your love. There is nothing in the past that can annul our right to each other; it is the first time we have either of us loved with our whole heart and soul.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie was still silent for a little while, looking down. Stephen was in a flutter of new hope; he was going to triumph. But she raised her eyes and met his with a glance that was filled with the anguish of regret, not with yielding. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, not with my whole heart and soul, Stephen,\u201d she said with timid resolution. \u201cI have never consented to it with my whole mind.

I couldn\u2019t live in peace if I put the shadow of a wilful sin between myself and God. I have caused sorrow already\u2014I know\u2014I feel it; but I have never deliberately consented to it; I have never said, \u2018They shall suffer, that I may have joy.\u2019 It has never been my will to marry you; if you were to win consent from the momentary triumph of my feeling for you, you would not have my whole soul. If I could wake back again into the time before yesterday, I would choose to be true to my calmer affections, and live without the joy of love.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Stephen loosed her hand, and rising impatiently, walked up and down the room in suppressed rage. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGood God!\u201d he burst out at last, \u201cwhat a miserable thing a woman\u2019s love is to a man\u2019s!

But you ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"don\u2019t")," love me; if you had a tithe of the feeling for me that I have for you, it would be impossible to you to think for a moment of sacrificing me. But it weighs nothing with you that you are robbing me of ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"my")," life\u2019s happiness.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie pressed her fingers together almost convulsively as she held them clasped on her lap. A great terror was upon her, as if she were ever and anon seeing where she stood by great flashes of lightning, and then again stretched forth her hands in the darkness. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, I don\u2019t sacrifice you\u2014I couldn\u2019t sacrifice you,\u201d she said, as soon as she could speak again; \u201cbut I can\u2019t believe in a good for you, that I feel, that we both feel, is a wrong toward others. We can\u2019t choose happiness either for ourselves or for another; we can\u2019t tell where that will lie. We can only choose whether we will indulge ourselves in the present moment, or whether we will renounce that, for the sake of obeying the divine voice within us,\u2014for the sake of being true to all the motives that sanctify our lives. I know this belief is hard; it has slipped away from me again and again; but I have felt that if I let it go forever, I should have no light through the darkness of this life.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut, Maggie,\u201d said Stephen, seating himself by her again, \u201cis it possible you don\u2019t see that what happened yesterday has altered the whole position of things? What infatuation is it, what obstinate prepossession, that blinds you to that? It is too late to say what we might have done or what we ought to have done. Admitting the very worst view of what has been done, it is a fact we must act on now; our position is altered; the right course is no longer what it was before. We must accept our own actions and start afresh from them. Suppose we had been married yesterday? It is nearly the same thing. The effect on others would not have been different. It would only have made this difference to ourselves,\u201d Stephen added bitterly, \u201cthat you might have acknowledged then that your tie to me was stronger than to others.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Again a deep flush came over Maggie\u2019s face, and she was silent. Stephen thought again that he was beginning to prevail,\u2014he had never yet believed that he should ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"not")," prevail; there are possibilities which our minds shrink from too completely for us to fear them. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDearest,\u201d he said, in his deepest, tenderest tone, leaning toward her, and putting his arm round her, \u201cyou ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"are")," mine now,\u2014the world believes it; duty must spring out of that now. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIn a few hours you will be legally mine, and those who had claims on us will submit,\u2014they will see that there was a force which declared against their claims.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie\u2019s eyes opened wide in one terrified look at the face that was close to hers, and she started up, pale again. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, I can\u2019t do it,\u201d she said, in a voice almost of agony; \u201cStephen, don\u2019t ask me\u2014don\u2019t urge me. I can\u2019t argue any longer,\u2014I don\u2019t know what is wise; but my heart will not let me do it. I see,\u2014I feel their trouble now; it is as if it were branded on my mind. ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I")," have suffered, and had no one to pity me; and now I have made others suffer. It would never leave me; it would embitter your love to me. I ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"do")," care for Philip\u2014in a different way; I remember all we said to each other; I know how he thought of me as the one promise of his life. He was given to me that I might make his lot less hard; and I have forsaken him. And Lucy\u2014she has been deceived; she who trusted me more than any one. I cannot marry you; I cannot take a good for myself that has been wrung out of their misery. It is not the force that ought to rule us,\u2014this that we feel for each other; it would rend me away from all that my past life has made dear and holy to me. I can\u2019t set out on a fresh life, and forget that; I must go back to it, and cling to it, else I shall feel as if there were nothing firm beneath my feet.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGood God, Maggie!\u201d said Stephen, rising too and grasping her arm, \u201cyou rave. How can you go back without marrying me? You don\u2019t know what will be said, dearest. You see nothing as it really is.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, I do. But they will believe me. I will confess everything. Lucy will believe me\u2014she will forgive you, and\u2014and\u2014oh, ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"some")," good will come by clinging to the right. Dear, dear Stephen, let me go!\u2014don\u2019t drag me into deeper remorse. My whole soul has never consented; it does not consent now.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Stephen let go her arm, and sank back on his chair, half-stunned by despairing rage. He was silent a few moments, not looking at her; while her eyes were turned toward him yearningly, in alarm at this sudden change. At last he said, still without looking at her,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGo, then,\u2014leave me; don\u2019t torture me any longer,\u2014I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Involuntarily she leaned toward him and put out her hand to touch his. But he shrank from it as if it had been burning iron, and said again,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLeave me.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie was not conscious of a decision as she turned away from that gloomy averted face, and walked out of the room; it was like an automatic action that fulfils a forgotten intention. What came after? A sense of stairs descended as if in a dream, of flagstones, of a chaise and horses standing, then a street, and a turning into another street where a stage-coach was standing, taking in passengers, and the darting thought that that coach would take her away, perhaps toward home. But she could ask nothing yet; she only got into the coach. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Home\u2014where her mother and brother were, Philip, Lucy, the scene of her very cares and trials\u2014was the haven toward which her mind tended; the sanctuary where sacred relics lay, where she would be rescued from more falling. The thought of Stephen was like a horrible throbbing pain, which yet, as such pains do, seemed to urge all other thoughts into activity. But among her thoughts, what others would say and think of her conduct was hardly present. Love and deep pity and remorseful anguish left no room for that. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The coach was taking her to York, farther away from home; but she did not learn that until she was set down in the old city at midnight. It was no matter; she could sleep there, and start home the next day. She had her purse in her pocket, with all her money in it,\u2014a bank-note and a sovereign; she had kept it in her pocket from forgetfulness, after going out to make purchases the day before yesterday. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Did she lie down in the gloomy bedroom of the old inn that night with her will bent unwaveringly on the path of penitent sacrifice? The great struggles of life are not so easy as that; the great problems of life are not so clear. In the darkness of that night she saw Stephen\u2019s face turned toward her in passionate, reproachful misery; she lived through again all the tremulous delights of his presence with her that made existence an easy floating in a stream of joy, instead of a quiet resolved endurance and effort. The love she had renounced came back upon her with a cruel charm; she felt herself opening her arms to receive it once more; and then it seemed to slip away and fade and vanish, leaving only the dying sound of a deep, thrilling voice that said, \u201cGone, forever gone.\u201d"))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

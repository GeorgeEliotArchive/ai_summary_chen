The sweet fresh garden-scent came through the open window, and the birds were busy flitting and alighting, gurgling and singing. Yet Maggie\u2019s eyes began to fill with tears. The sight of the old scenes had made the rush of memories so painful that even yesterday she had only been able to rejoice in her mother\u2019s restored comfort and Tom\u2019s brotherly friendliness as we rejoice in good news of friends at a distance, rather than in the presence of a happiness which we share. Memory and imagination urged upon her a sense of privation too keen to let her taste what was offered in the transient present. Her future, she thought, was likely to be worse than her past, for after her years of contented renunciation, she had slipped back into desire and longing; she found joyless days of distasteful occupation harder and harder; she found the image of the intense and varied life she yearned for, and despaired of, becoming more and more importunate. The sound of the opening door roused her, and hastily wiping away her tears, she began to turn over the leaves of her book. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere is one pleasure, I know, Maggie, that your deepest dismalness will never resist,\u201d said Lucy, beginning to speak as soon as she entered the room. \u201cThat is music, and I mean you to have quite a riotous feast of it.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI ought rather to have said, one particular thing. Because if you feel just as he does about that, we shall want our third voice. St Ogg\u2019s is so miserably provided with musical gentlemen. There are really only Stephen and Philip Wakem who have any knowledge of music, so as to be able to sing a part.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Lucy had looked up from her work as she uttered the last sentence, and saw that there was a change in Maggie\u2019s face.

I\u2019m very fond of poor Philip, only I wish he were not so morbid about his deformity. I suppose it ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"is")," his deformity that makes him so sad, and sometimes bitter.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet me introduce you to my cousin, Miss Tulliver,\u201d said Lucy, turning with wicked enjoyment toward Maggie, who now approached from the farther window. \u201cThis is Mr Stephen Guest.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  For one instant Stephen could not conceal his astonishment at the sight of this tall, dark-eyed nymph with her jet-black coronet of hair; the next, Maggie felt herself, for the first time in her life, receiving the tribute of a very deep blush and a very deep bow from a person toward whom she herself was conscious of timidity. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  This new experience was very agreeable to her, so agreeable that it almost effaced her previous emotion about Philip. There was a new brightness in her eyes, and a very becoming flush on her cheek, as she seated herself. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI hope you perceive what a striking likeness you drew the day before yesterday,\u201d said Lucy, with a pretty laugh of triumph. She enjoyed her lover\u2019s confusion; the advantage was usually on his side. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThis designing cousin of yours quite deceived me, Miss Tulliver,\u201d said Stephen, seating himself by Lucy, and stooping to play with Minny, only looking at Maggie furtively. \u201cShe said you had light hair and blue eyes.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, it was you who said so,\u201d remonstrated Lucy. \u201cI only refrained from destroying your confidence in your own second-sight.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI wish I could always err in the same way,\u201d said Stephen, \u201cand find reality so much more beautiful than my preconceptions.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow you have proved yourself equal to the occasion,\u201d said Maggie, \u201cand said what it was incumbent on you to say under the circumstances.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  She flashed a slightly defiant look at him; it was clear to her that he had been drawing a satirical portrait of her beforehand.

The second, when she had bent over her work, was, \u201cI wish she would look at me again.\u201d The next was to answer,\u2014 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI suppose all phrases of mere compliment have their turn to be true. A man is occasionally grateful when he says \u2018Thank you.\u2019 It\u2019s rather hard upon him that he must use the same words with which all the world declines a disagreeable invitation, don\u2019t you think so, Miss Tulliver?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo,\u201d said Maggie, looking at him with her direct glance; \u201cif we use common words on a great occasion, they are the more striking, because they are felt at once to have a particular meaning, like old banners, or everyday clothes, hung up in a sacred place.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThen my compliment ought to be eloquent,\u201d said Stephen, really not quite knowing what he said while Maggie looked at him, \u201cseeing that the words were so far beneath the occasion.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo compliment can be eloquent, except as an expression of indifference,\u201d said Maggie, flushing a little.

She was so unused to society that she could take nothing as a matter of course, and had never in her life spoken from the lips merely, so that she must necessarily appear absurd to more experienced ladies, from the excessive feeling she was apt to throw into very trivial incidents. But she was even conscious herself of a little absurdity in this instance. It was true she had a theoretic objection to compliments, and had once said impatiently to Philip that she didn\u2019t see why women were to be told with a simper that they were beautiful, any more than old men were to be told that they were venerable; still, to be so irritated by a common practice in the case of a stranger like Mr Stephen Guest, and to care about his having spoken slightingly of her before he had seen her, was certainly unreasonable, and as soon as she was silent she began to be ashamed of herself. It did not occur to her that her irritation was due to the pleasanter emotion which preceded it, just as when we are satisfied with a sense of glowing warmth an innocent drop of cold water may fall upon us as a sudden smart. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Stephen was too well bred not to seem unaware that the previous conversation could have been felt embarrassing, and at once began to talk of impersonal matters, asking Lucy if she knew when the bazaar was at length to take place, so that there might be some hope of seeing her rain the influence of her eyes on objects more grateful than those worsted flowers that were growing under her fingers. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSome day next month, I believe,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cBut your sisters are doing more for it than I am; they are to have the largest stall.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh yes; but they carry on their manufactures in their own sitting-room, where I don\u2019t intrude on them.

She did not quite like that Stephen should know that; Maggie need not have mentioned it. Perhaps there was some pride in the confession,\u2014the pride of poverty that will not be ashamed of itself. But if Maggie had been the queen of coquettes she could hardly have invented a means of giving greater piquancy to her beauty in Stephen\u2019s eyes; I am not sure that the quiet admission of plain sewing and poverty would have done alone, but assisted by the beauty, they made Maggie more unlike other women even than she had seemed at first. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut I can knit, Lucy,\u201d Maggie went on, \u201cif that will be of any use for your bazaar.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh yes, of infinite use. I shall set you to work with scarlet wool to-morrow. But your sister is the most enviable person,\u201d continued Lucy, turning to Stephen, \u201cto have the talent of modelling. She is doing a wonderful bust of Dr Kenn entirely from memory.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, if she can remember to put the eyes very near together, and the corners of the mouth very far apart, the likeness can hardly fail to be striking in St Ogg\u2019s.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow that is very wicked of you,\u201d said Lucy, looking rather hurt. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would speak disrespectfully of Dr Kenn.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI say anything disrespectful of Dr Kenn? Heaven forbid! But I am not bound to respect a libellous bust of him. I think Kenn one of the finest fellows in the world. I don\u2019t care much about the tall candlesticks he has put on the communion-table, and I shouldn\u2019t like to spoil my temper by getting up to early prayers every morning. But he\u2019s the only man I ever knew personally who seems to me to have anything of the real apostle in him,\u2014a man who has eight hundred a-year and is contented with deal furniture and boiled beef because he gives away two-thirds of his income. That was a very fine thing of him,\u2014taking into his house that poor lad Grattan, who shot his mother by accident. He sacrifices more time than a less busy man could spare, to save the poor fellow from getting into a morbid state of mind about it. He takes the lad out with him constantly, I see.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat is beautiful,\u201d said Maggie, who had let her work fall, and was listening with keen interest. \u201cI never knew any one who did such things.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd one admires that sort of action in Kenn all the more,\u201d said Stephen, \u201cbecause his manners in general are rather cold and severe. There\u2019s nothing sugary and maudlin about him.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, I think he\u2019s a perfect character!\u201d said Lucy, with pretty enthusiasm. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo; there I can\u2019t agree with you,\u201d said Stephen, shaking his head with sarcastic gravity. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow, what fault can you point out in him?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHe\u2019s an Anglican.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, those are the right views, I think,\u201d said Lucy, gravely. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat settles the question in the abstract,\u201d said Stephen, \u201cbut not from a parliamentary point of view. He has set the Dissenters and the Church people by the ears; and a rising senator like myself, of whose services the country is very much in need, will find it inconvenient when he puts up for the honour of representing St Ogg\u2019s in Parliament.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDo you really think of that?\u201d said Lucy, her eyes brightening with a proud pleasure that made her neglect the argumentative interests of Anglicanism. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDecidedly, whenever old Mr Leyburn\u2019s public spirit and gout induce him to give way. My father\u2019s heart is set on it; and gifts like mine, you know\u201d\u2014here Stephen drew himself up, and rubbed his large white hands over his hair with playful self-admiration\u2014\u201cgifts like mine involve great responsibilities. Don\u2019t you think so, Miss Tulliver?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Maggie, smiling, but not looking up; \u201cso much fluency and self-possession should not be wasted entirely on private occasions.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, I see how much penetration you have,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cYou have discovered already that I am talkative and impudent. Now superficial people never discern that, owing to my manner, I suppose.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look at me when I talk of myself,\u201d he thought, while his listeners were laughing. \u201cI must try other subjects.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Did Lucy intend to be present at the meeting of the Book Club next week? was the next question. Then followed the recommendation to choose Southey\u2019s \u201cLife of Cowper,\u201d unless she were inclined to be philosophical, and startle the ladies of St Ogg\u2019s by voting for one of the Bridgewater Treatises. Of course Lucy wished to know what these alarmingly learned books were; and as it is always pleasant to improve the minds of ladies by talking to them at ease on subjects of which they know nothing, Stephen became quite brilliant in an account of Buckland\u2019s Treatise, which he had just been reading. He was rewarded by seeing Maggie let her work fall, and gradually get so absorbed in his wonderful geological story that she sat looking at him, leaning forward with crossed arms, and with an entire absence of self-consciousness, as if he had been the snuffiest of old professors, and she a downy-lipped alumna. He was so fascinated by the clear, large gaze that at last he forgot to look away from it occasionally toward Lucy; but she, sweet child, was only rejoicing that Stephen was proving to Maggie how clever he was, and that they would certainly be good friends after all. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI will bring you the book, shall I, Miss Tulliver?\u201d said Stephen, when he found the stream of his recollections running rather shallow. \u201cThere are many illustrations in it that you will like to see.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, thank you,\u201d said Maggie, blushing with returning self-consciousness at this direct address, and taking up her work again. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, no,\u201d Lucy interposed. \u201cI must forbid your plunging Maggie in books. I shall never get her away from them; and I want her to have delicious do-nothing days, filled with boating and chatting and riding and driving; that is the holiday she needs.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cApropos!\u201d said Stephen, looking at his watch. \u201cShall we go out for a row on the river now? The tide will suit for us to the Tofton way, and we can walk back.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  That was a delightful proposition to Maggie, for it was years since she had been on the river. When she was gone to put on her bonnet, Lucy lingered to give an order to the servant, and took the opportunity of telling Stephen that Maggie had no objection to seeing Philip, so that it was a pity she had sent that note the day before yesterday. But she would write another to-morrow and invite him. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ll call and beat him up to-morrow,\u201d said Stephen, \u201cand bring him with me in the evening, shall I? My sisters will want to call on you when I tell them your cousin is with you. I must leave the field clear for them in the morning.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh yes, pray bring him,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cAnd you ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"will")," like Maggie, sha\u2019n\u2019t you?\u201d she added, in a beseeching tone. \u201cIsn\u2019t she a dear, noble-looking creature?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cToo tall,\u201d said Stephen, smiling down upon her, \u201cand a little too fiery. She is not my type of woman, you know.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Gentlemen, you are aware, are apt to impart these imprudent confidences to ladies concerning their unfavourable opinion of sister fair ones. That is why so many women have the advantage of knowing that they are secretly repulsive to men who have self-denyingly made ardent love to them. And hardly anything could be more distinctively characteristic of Lucy than that she both implicitly believed what Stephen said, and was determined that Maggie should not know it. But you, who have a higher logic than the verbal to guide you, have already foreseen, as the direct sequence to that unfavourable opinion of Stephen\u2019s, that he walked down to the boathouse calculating, by the aid of a vivid imagination, that Maggie must give him her hand at least twice in consequence of this pleasant boating plan, and that a gentleman who wishes ladies to look at him is advantageously situated when he is rowing them in a boat. What then? Had he fallen in love with this surprising daughter of Mrs Tulliver at first sight? Certainly not. Such passions are never heard of in real life. Besides, he was in love already, and half-engaged to the dearest little creature in the world; and he was not a man to make a fool of himself in any way. But when one is five-and-twenty, one has not chalk-stones at one\u2019s finger-ends that the touch of a handsome girl should be entirely indifferent. It was perfectly natural and safe to admire beauty and enjoy looking at it,\u2014at least under such circumstances as the present. And there was really something very interesting about this girl, with her poverty and troubles; it was gratifying to see the friendship between the two cousins. Generally, Stephen admitted, he was not fond of women who had any peculiarity of character, but here the peculiarity seemed really of a superior kind, and provided one is not obliged to marry such women, why, they certainly make a variety in social intercourse. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie did not fulfil Stephen\u2019s hope by looking at him during the first quarter of an hour; her eyes were too full of the old banks that she knew so well. She felt lonely, cut off from Philip,\u2014the only person who had ever seemed to love her devotedly, as she had always longed to be loved. But presently the rhythmic movement of the oars attracted her, and she thought she should like to learn how to row. This roused her from her reverie, and she asked if she might take an oar. It appeared that she required much teaching, and she became ambitious. The exercise brought the warm blood into her cheeks, and made her inclined to take her lesson merrily. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI shall not be satisfied until I can manage both oars, and row you and Lucy,\u201d she said, looking very bright as she stepped out of the boat. Maggie, we know, was apt to forget the thing she was doing, and she had chosen an inopportune moment for her remark; her foot slipped, but happily Mr Stephen Guest held her hand, and kept her up with a firm grasp. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou have not hurt yourself at all, I hope?\u201d he said, bending to look in her face with anxiety. It was very charming to be taken care of in that kind, graceful manner by some one taller and stronger than one\u2019s self. Maggie had never felt just in the same way before. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  When they reached home again, they found uncle and aunt Pullet seated with Mrs Tulliver in the drawing-room, and Stephen hurried away, asking leave to come again in the evening. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd pray bring with you the volume of Purcell that you took away,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cI want Maggie to hear your best songs.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Aunt Pullet, under the certainty that Maggie would be invited to go out with Lucy, probably to Park House, was much shocked at the shabbiness of her clothes, which when witnessed by the higher society of St Ogg\u2019s, would be a discredit to the family, that demanded a strong and prompt remedy; and the consultation as to what would be most suitable to this end from among the superfluities of Mrs Pullet\u2019s wardrobe was one that Lucy as well as Mrs Tulliver entered into with some zeal. Maggie must really have an evening dress as soon as possible, and she was about the same height as aunt Pullet. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut she\u2019s so much broader across the shoulders than I am, it\u2019s very ill-convenient,\u201d said Mrs Pullet, \u201celse she might wear that beautiful black brocade o\u2019 mine without any alteration; and her arms are beyond everything,\u201d added Mrs Pullet, sorrowfully, as she lifted Maggie\u2019s large round arm, \u201cShe\u2019d never get my sleeves on.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, never mind that, aunt; send us the dress,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cI don\u2019t mean Maggie to have long sleeves, and I have abundance of black lace for trimming. Her arms will look beautiful.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMaggie\u2019s arms ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"are")," a pretty shape,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver. \u201cThey\u2019re like mine used to be, only mine was never brown; I wish she\u2019d had ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"our")," family skin.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNonsense, aunty!\u201d said Lucy, patting her aunt Tulliver\u2019s shoulder, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand those things.

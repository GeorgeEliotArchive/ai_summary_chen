Few wives were more submissive than Mrs Tulliver on all points unconnected with her family relations; but she had been a Miss Dodson, and the Dodsons were a very respectable family indeed,\u2014as much looked up to as any in their own parish, or the next to it. The Miss Dodsons had always been thought to hold up their heads very high, and no one was surprised the two eldest had married so well,\u2014not at an early age, for that was not the practice of the Dodson family. There were particular ways of doing everything in that family: particular ways of bleaching the linen, of making the cowslip wine, curing the hams, and keeping the bottled gooseberries; so that no daughter of that house could be indifferent to the privilege of having been born a Dodson, rather than a Gibson or a Watson. Funerals were always conducted with peculiar propriety in the Dodson family: the hat-bands were never of a blue shade, the gloves never split at the thumb, everybody was a mourner who ought to be, and there were always scarfs for the bearers. When one of the family was in trouble or sickness, all the rest went to visit the unfortunate member, usually at the same time, and did not shrink from uttering the most disagreeable truths that correct family feeling dictated; if the illness or trouble was the sufferer\u2019s own fault, it was not in the practice of the Dodson family to shrink from saying so. In short, there was in this family a peculiar tradition as to what was the right thing in household management and social demeanour, and the only bitter circumstance attending this superiority was a painful inability to approve the condiments or the conduct of families ungoverned by the Dodson tradition. A female Dodson, when in \u201cstrange houses,\u201d always ate dry bread with her tea, and declined any sort of preserves, having no confidence in the butter, and thinking that the preserves had probably begun to ferment from want of due sugar and boiling. There were some Dodsons less like the family than others, that was admitted; but in so far as they were \u201ckin,\u201d they were of necessity better than those who were \u201cno kin.\u201d And it is remarkable that while no individual Dodson was satisfied with any other individual Dodson, each was satisfied, not only with him or herself, but with the Dodsons collectively. The feeblest member of a family\u2014the one who has the least character\u2014is often the merest epitome of the family habits and traditions; and Mrs Tulliver was a thorough Dodson, though a mild one, as small-beer, so long as it is anything, is only describable as very weak ale: and though she had groaned a little in her youth under the yoke of her elder sisters, and still shed occasional tears at their sisterly reproaches, it was not in Mrs Tulliver to be an innovator on the family ideas. She was thankful to have been a Dodson, and to have one child who took after her own family, at least in his features and complexion, in liking salt and in eating beans, which a Tulliver never did. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  In other respects the true Dodson was partly latent in Tom, and he was as far from appreciating his \u201ckin\u201d on the mother\u2019s side as Maggie herself, generally absconding for the day with a large supply of the most portable food, when he received timely warning that his aunts and uncles were coming,\u2014a moral symptom from which his aunt Glegg deduced the gloomiest views of his future. It was rather hard on Maggie that Tom always absconded without letting her into the secret, but the weaker sex are acknowledged to be serious ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"impedimenta")," in cases of flight. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  On Wednesday, the day before the aunts and uncles were coming, there were such various and suggestive scents, as of plumcakes in the oven and jellies in the hot state, mingled with the aroma of gravy, that it was impossible to feel altogether gloomy: there was hope in the air. Tom and Maggie made several inroads into the kitchen, and, like other marauders, were induced to keep aloof for a time only by being allowed to carry away a sufficient load of booty.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie, thinking it was no use to contend further, began too, and ate up her half puff with considerable relish as well as rapidity. But Tom had finished first, and had to look on while Maggie ate her last morsel or two, feeling in himself a capacity for more.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, you greedy thing!\u201d said Tom, when she had swallowed the last morsel.

Yet the excellent dog accepted Tom\u2019s attention with as much alacrity as if he had been treated quite generously. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But Maggie, gifted with that superior power of misery which distinguishes the human being, and places him at a proud distance from the most melancholy chimpanzee, sat still on her bough, and gave herself up to the keen sense of unmerited reproach. She would have given the world not to have eaten all her puff, and to have saved some of it for Tom. Not but that the puff was very nice, for Maggie\u2019s palate was not at all obtuse, but she would have gone without it many times over, sooner than Tom should call her greedy and be cross with her. And he had said he wouldn\u2019t have it, and she ate it without thinking; how could she help it? The tears flowed so plentifully that Maggie saw nothing around her for the next ten minutes; but by that time resentment began to give way to the desire of reconciliation, and she jumped from her bough to look for Tom. He was no longer in the paddock behind the rickyard; where was he likely to be gone, and Yap with him? Maggie ran to the high bank against the great holly-tree, where she could see far away toward the Floss. There was Tom; but her heart sank again as she saw how far off he was on his way to the great river, and that he had another companion besides Yap,\u2014naughty Bob Jakin, whose official, if not natural, function of frightening the birds was just now at a standstill. Maggie felt sure that Bob was wicked, without very distinctly knowing why; unless it was because Bob\u2019s mother was a dreadfully large fat woman, who lived at a queer round house down the river; and once, when Maggie and Tom had wandered thither, there rushed out a brindled dog that wouldn\u2019t stop barking; and when Bob\u2019s mother came out after it, and screamed above the barking to tell them not to be frightened, Maggie thought she was scolding them fiercely, and her heart beat with terror. Maggie thought it very likely that the round house had snakes on the floor, and bats in the bedroom; for she had seen Bob take off his cap to show Tom a little snake that was inside it, and another time he had a handful of young bats: altogether, he was an irregular character, perhaps even slightly diabolical, judging from his intimacy with snakes and bats; and to crown all, when Tom had Bob for a companion, he didn\u2019t mind about Maggie, and would never let her go with him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It must be owned that Tom was fond of Bob\u2019s company. How could it be otherwise? Bob knew, directly he saw a bird\u2019s egg, whether it was a swallow\u2019s, or a tomtit\u2019s, or a yellow-hammer\u2019s; he found out all the wasps\u2019 nests, and could set all sorts of traps; he could climb the trees like a squirrel, and had quite a magical power of detecting hedgehogs and stoats; and he had courage to do things that were rather naughty, such as making gaps in the hedgerows, throwing stones after the sheep, and killing a cat that was wandering ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"incognito"),". Such qualities in an inferior, who could always be treated with authority in spite of his superior knowingness, had necessarily a fatal fascination for Tom; and every holiday-time Maggie was sure to have days of grief because he had gone off with Bob. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Well! there was no hope for it; he was gone now, and Maggie could think of no comfort but to sit down by the hollow, or wander by the hedgerow, and fancy it was all different, refashioning her little world into just what she should like it to be. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie\u2019s was a troublous life, and this was the form in which she took her opium. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Meanwhile Tom, forgetting all about Maggie and the sting of reproach which he had left in her heart, was hurrying along with Bob, whom he had met accidentally, to the scene of a great rat-catching in a neighbouring barn. Bob knew all about this particular affair, and spoke of the sport with an enthusiasm which no one who is not either divested of all manly feeling, or pitiably ignorant of rat-catching, can fail to imagine. For a person suspected of preternatural wickedness, Bob was really not so very villanous-looking; there was even something agreeable in his snub-nosed face, with its close-curled border of red hair. But then his trousers were always rolled up at the knee, for the convenience of wading on the slightest notice; and his virtue, supposing it to exist, was undeniably \u201cvirtue in rags,\u201d which, on the authority even of bilious philosophers, who think all well-dressed merit overpaid, is notoriously likely to remain unrecognised (perhaps because it is seen so seldom). "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI know the chap as owns the ferrets,\u201d said Bob, in a hoarse treble voice, as he shuffled along, keeping his blue eyes fixed on the river, like an amphibious animal who foresaw occasion for darting in. \u201cHe lives up the Kennel Yard at Sut Ogg\u2019s, he does. He\u2019s the biggest rot-catcher anywhere, he is. I\u2019d sooner, be a rot-catcher nor anything, I would. The moles is nothing to the rots. But Lors! you mun ha\u2019 ferrets. Dogs is no good.

It was the plunging of some small body in the water from among the neighbouring bulrushes; if it was not a water-rat, Bob intimated that he was ready to undergo the most unpleasant consequences.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cUgh! you coward!\u201d said Tom, and kicked him over, feeling humiliated as a sportsman to possess so poor-spirited an animal. Bob abstained from remark and passed on, choosing, however, to walk in the shallow edge of the overflowing river by way of change. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHe\u2019s none so full now, the Floss isn\u2019t,\u201d said Bob, as he kicked the water up before him, with an agreeable sense of being insolent to it. \u201cWhy, last \u2019ear, the meadows was all one sheet o\u2019 water, they was.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, but,\u201d said Tom, whose mind was prone to see an opposition between statements that were really accordant,\u2014\u201cbut there was a big flood once, when the Round Pool was made.

And then if the flood came, you know, Bob, I shouldn\u2019t mind. And I\u2019d take you in, if I saw you swimming,\u201d he added, in the tone of a benevolent patron.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom\u2019s blood was thoroughly up: he went at Bob with a lunge and threw him down, but Bob seized hold and kept it like a cat, and pulled Tom down after him. They struggled fiercely on the ground for a moment or two, till Tom, pinning Bob down by the shoulders, thought he had the mastery. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201c",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"You"),", say you\u2019ll give me the halfpenny now,\u201d he said, with difficulty, while he exerted himself to keep the command of Bob\u2019s arms. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But at this moment Yap, who had been running on before, returned barking to the scene of action, and saw a favourable opportunity for biting Bob\u2019s bare leg not only with inpunity but with honour. The pain from Yap\u2019s teeth, instead of surprising Bob into a relaxation of his hold, gave it a fiercer tenacity, and with a new exertion of his force he pushed Tom backward and got uppermost. But now Yap, who could get no sufficient purchase before, set his teeth in a new place, so that Bob, harassed in this way, let go his hold of Tom, and, almost throttling Yap, flung him into the river. By this time Tom was up again, and before Bob had quite recovered his balance after the act of swinging Yap, Tom fell upon him, threw him down, and got his knees firmly on Bob\u2019s chest. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou give me the halfpenny now,\u201d said Tom. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTake it,\u201d said Bob, sulkily.

I sha\u2019n\u2019t go along with you any more,\u201d he added, turning round homeward, not without casting a regret toward the rat-catching and other pleasures which he must relinquish along with Bob\u2019s society. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou may let it alone, then,\u201d Bob called out after him. \u201cI shall cheat if I like; there\u2019s no fun i\u2019 playing else; and I know where there\u2019s a goldfinch\u2019s nest, but I\u2019ll take care ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you")," don\u2019t.

But Tom was not to be provoked into turning round, and Bob\u2019s voice began to falter a little as he said,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019n gi\u2019en you everything, an\u2019 showed you everything, an\u2019 niver wanted nothin\u2019 from you. An\u2019 there\u2019s your horn-handed knife, then as you gi\u2019en me.\u201d Here Bob flung the knife as far as he could after Tom\u2019s retreating footsteps. But it produced no effect, except the sense in Bob\u2019s mind that there was a terrible void in his lot, now that knife was gone. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He stood still till Tom had passed through the gate and disappeared behind the hedge. The knife would do no good on the ground there; it wouldn\u2019t vex Tom; and pride or resentment was a feeble passion in Bob\u2019s mind compared with the love of a pocket-knife. His very fingers sent entreating thrills that he would go and clutch that familiar rough buck\u2019s-horn handle, which they had so often grasped for mere affection, as it lay idle in his pocket. And there were two blades, and they had just been sharpened! What is life without a pocket-knife to him who has once tasted a higher existence? No; to throw the handle after the hatchet is a comprehensible act of desperation, but to throw one\u2019s pocket-knife after an implacable friend is clearly in every sense a hyperbole, or throwing beyond the mark. So Bob shuffled back to the spot where the beloved knife lay in the dirt, and felt quite a new pleasure in clutching it again after the temporary separation, in opening one blade after the other, and feeling their edge with his well-hardened thumb. Poor Bob! he was not sensitive on the point of honour, not a chivalrous character. That fine moral aroma would not have been thought much of by the public opinion of Kennel Yard, which was the very focus or heart of Bob\u2019s world, even if it could have made itself perceptible there; yet, for all that, he was not utterly a sneak and a thief as our friend Tom had hastily decided. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But Tom, you perceive, was rather a Rhadamanthine personage, having more than the usual share of boy\u2019s justice in him,\u2014the justice that desires to hurt culprits as much as they deserve to be hurt, and is troubled with no doubts concerning the exact amount of their deserts. Maggie saw a cloud on his brow when he came home, which checked her joy at his coming so much sooner than she had expected, and she dared hardly speak to him as he stood silently throwing the small gravel-stones into the mill-dam. It is not pleasant to give up a rat-catching when you have set your mind on it. But if Tom had told his strongest feeling at that moment, he would have said, \u201cI\u2019d do just the same again.\u201d That was his usual mode of viewing his past actions; whereas Maggie was always wishing she had done something different."))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

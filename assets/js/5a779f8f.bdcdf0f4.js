"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"This was not the first time that Mr. Farebrother had heard hints of Lydgate\u2019s expenses being obviously too great to be met by his practice, but he thought it not unlikely that there were resources or expectations which excused the large outlay at the time of Lydgate\u2019s marriage, and which might hinder any bad consequences from the disappointment in his practice. One evening, when he took the pains to go to Middlemarch on purpose to have a chat with Lydgate as of old, he noticed in him an air of excited effort quite unlike his usual easy way of keeping silence or breaking it with abrupt energy whenever he had anything to say. Lydgate talked persistently when they were in his work-room, putting arguments for and against the probability of certain biological views; but he had none of those definite things to say or to show which give the waymarks of a patient uninterrupted pursuit, such as he used himself to insist on, saying that \u201cthere must be a systole and diastole in all inquiry,\u201d and that \u201ca man\u2019s mind must be continually expanding and shrinking between the whole human horizon and the horizon of an object-glass.\u201d That evening he seemed to be talking widely for the sake of resisting any personal bearing; and before long they went into the drawing room, where Lydgate, having asked Rosamond to give them music, sank back in his chair in silence, but with a strange light in his eyes. \u201cHe may have been taking an opiate,\u201d was a thought that crossed Mr. Farebrother\u2019s mind\u2014\u201ctic-douloureux perhaps\u2014or medical worries.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"It did not occur to him that Lydgate\u2019s marriage was not delightful: he believed, as the rest did, that Rosamond was an amiable, docile creature, though he had always thought her rather uninteresting\u2014a little too much the pattern-card of the finishing-school; and his mother could not forgive Rosamond because she never seemed to see that Henrietta Noble was in the room. \u201cHowever, Lydgate fell in love with her,\u201d said the Vicar to himself, \u201cand she must be to his taste.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"Mr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having very little corresponding fibre in himself, and perhaps too little care about personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or foolish, he could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate shrank, as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about his private affairs. And soon after that conversation at Mr. Toller\u2019s, the Vicar learned something which made him watch the more eagerly for an opportunity of indirectly letting Lydgate know that if he wanted to open himself about any difficulty there was a friendly ear ready. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"The opportunity came at Mr. Vincy\u2019s, where, on New Year\u2019s Day, there was a party, to which Mr. Farebrother was irresistibly invited, on the plea that he must not forsake his old friends on the first new year of his being a greater man, and Rector as well as Vicar. And this party was thoroughly friendly: all the ladies of the Farebrother family were present; the Vincy children all dined at the table, and Fred had persuaded his mother that if she did not invite Mary Garth, the Farebrothers would regard it as a slight to themselves, Mary being their particular friend. Mary came, and Fred was in high spirits, though his enjoyment was of a checkered kind\u2014triumph that his mother should see Mary\u2019s importance with the chief personages in the party being much streaked with jealousy when Mr. Farebrother sat down by her. Fred used to be much more easy about his own accomplishments in the days when he had not begun to dread being \u201cbowled out by Farebrother,\u201d and this terror was still before him. Mrs. Vincy, in her fullest matronly bloom, looked at Mary\u2019s little figure, rough wavy hair, and visage quite without lilies and roses, and wondered; trying unsuccessfully to fancy herself caring about Mary\u2019s appearance in wedding clothes, or feeling complacency in grandchildren who would \u201cfeature\u201d the Garths. However, the party was a merry one, and Mary was particularly bright; being glad, for Fred\u2019s sake, that his friends were getting kinder to her, and being also quite willing that they should see how much she was valued by others whom they must admit to be judges. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"Mr. Farebrother noticed that Lydgate seemed bored, and that Mr. Vincy spoke as little as possible to his son-in-law. Rosamond was perfectly graceful and calm, and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar had not been roused to bestow on her would have perceived the total absence of that interest in her husband\u2019s presence which a loving wife is sure to betray, even if etiquette keeps her aloof from him. When Lydgate was taking part in the conversation, she never looked towards him any more than if she had been a sculptured Psyche modelled to look another way: and when, after being called out for an hour or two, he re-entered the room, she seemed unconscious of the fact, which eighteen months before would have had the effect of a numeral before ciphers. In reality, however, she was intensely aware of Lydgate\u2019s voice and movements; and her pretty good-tempered air of unconsciousness was a studied negation by which she satisfied her inward opposition to him without compromise of propriety. When the ladies were in the drawing-room after Lydgate had been called away from the dessert, Mrs. Farebrother, when Rosamond happened to be near her, said\u2014\u201cYou have to give up a great deal of your husband\u2019s society, Mrs. Lydgate.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cYes, the life of a medical man is very arduous: especially when he is so devoted to his profession as Mr. Lydgate is,\u201d said Rosamond, who was standing, and moved easily away at the end of this correct little speech.

You know, Mrs. Farebrother, ours is a cheerful house. I am of a cheerful disposition myself, and Mr. Vincy always likes something to be going on. That is what Rosamond has been used to.

But my children are all good-tempered, thank God.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"This was easily credible to any one looking at Mrs. Vincy as she threw back her broad cap-strings, and smiled towards her three little girls, aged from seven to eleven. But in that smiling glance she was obliged to include Mary Garth, whom the three girls had got into a corner to make her tell them stories. Mary was just finishing the delicious tale of Rumpelstiltskin, which she had well by heart, because Letty was never tired of communicating it to her ignorant elders from a favorite red volume. Louisa, Mrs. Vincy\u2019s darling, now ran to her with wide-eyed serious excitement, crying, \u201cOh mamma, mamma, the little man stamped so hard on the floor he couldn\u2019t get his leg out again!\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cBless you, my cherub!\u201d said mamma; \u201cyou shall tell me all about it to-morrow.

Fred, who had also seated himself near, would have felt unmixed triumph in Mary\u2019s effectiveness if Mr. Farebrother had not been looking at her with evident admiration, while he dramatized an intense interest in the tale to please the children.

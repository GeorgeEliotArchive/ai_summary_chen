To be sure, a stone floor was not the pleasantest to dance on, but then, most of the dancers had known what it was to enjoy a Christmas dance on kitchen quarries. It was one of those entrance-halls which make the surrounding rooms look like closets\u2014with stucco angels, trumpets, and flower-wreaths on the lofty ceiling, and great medallions of miscellaneous heroes on the walls, alternating with statues in niches. Just the sort of place to be ornamented well with green boughs, and Mr. Craig had been proud to show his taste and his hothouse plants on the occasion. The broad steps of the stone staircase were covered with cushions to serve as seats for the children, who were to stay till half-past nine with the servant-maids to see the dancing, and as this dance was confined to the chief tenants, there was abundant room for every one. The lights were charmingly disposed in coloured-paper lamps, high up among green boughs, and the farmers\u2019 wives and daughters, as they peeped in, believed no scene could be more splendid; they knew now quite well in what sort of rooms the king and queen lived, and their thoughts glanced with some pity towards cousins and acquaintances who had not this fine opportunity of knowing how things went on in the great world. The lamps were already lit, though the sun had not long set, and there was that calm light out of doors in which we seem to see all objects more distinctly than in the broad day. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It was a pretty scene outside the house: the farmers and their families were moving about the lawn, among the flowers and shrubs, or along the broad straight road leading from the east front, where a carpet of mossy grass spread on each side, studded here and there with a dark flat-boughed cedar, or a grand pyramidal fir sweeping the ground with its branches, all tipped with a fringe of paler green. The groups of cottagers in the park were gradually diminishing, the young ones being attracted towards the lights that were beginning to gleam from the windows of the gallery in the abbey, which was to be their dancing-room, and some of the sober elder ones thinking it time to go home quietly. One of these was Lisbeth Bede, and Seth went with her\u2014not from filial attention only, for his conscience would not let him join in dancing. It had been rather a melancholy day to Seth: Dinah had never been more constantly present with him than in this scene, where everything was so unlike her. He saw her all the more vividly after looking at the thoughtless faces and gay-coloured dresses of the young women\u2014just as one feels the beauty and the greatness of a pictured Madonna the more when it has been for a moment screened from us by a vulgar head in a bonnet. But this presence of Dinah in his mind only helped him to bear the better with his mother\u2019s mood, which had been becoming more and more querulous for the last hour. Poor Lisbeth was suffering from a strange conflict of feelings. Her joy and pride in the honour paid to her darling son Adam was beginning to be worsted in the conflict with the jealousy and fretfulness which had revived when Adam came to tell her that Captain Donnithorne desired him to join the dancers in the hall. Adam was getting more and more out of her reach; she wished all the old troubles back again, for then it mattered more to Adam what his mother said and did.

His eye soon detected a distant group, which he knew to be the right one, returning to the house along the broad gravel road, and he hastened on to meet them. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, Adam, I\u2019m glad to get sight on y\u2019 again,\u201d said Mr. Poyser, who was carrying Totty on his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re going t\u2019 have a bit o\u2019 fun, I hope, now your work\u2019s all done.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere\u2019s the big clock strikin\u2019 eight,\u201d said Mr. Poyser; \u201cwe must make haste in now, else the squire and the ladies \u2019ull be in afore us, an\u2019 that wouldna look well.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  When they had entered the hall, and the three children under Molly\u2019s charge had been seated on the stairs, the folding-doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and Arthur entered in his regimentals, leading Mrs. Irwine to a carpet-covered dais ornamented with hot-house plants, where she and Miss Anne were to be seated with old Mr. Donnithorne, that they might look on at the dancing, like the kings and queens in the plays. Arthur had put on his uniform to please the tenants, he said, who thought as much of his militia dignity as if it had been an elevation to the premiership. He had not the least objection to gratify them in that way: his uniform was very advantageous to his figure. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The old squire, before sitting down, walked round the hall to greet the tenants and make polite speeches to the wives: he was always polite; but the farmers had found out, after long puzzling, that this polish was one of the signs of hardness. It was observed that he gave his most elaborate civility to Mrs. Poyser to-night, inquiring particularly about her health, recommending her to strengthen herself with cold water as he did, and avoid all drugs. Mrs. Poyser curtsied and thanked him with great self-command, but when he had passed on, she whispered to her husband, \u201cI\u2019ll lay my life he\u2019s brewin\u2019 some nasty turn against us. Old Harry doesna wag his tail so for nothin\u2019.\u201d Mr. Poyser had no time to answer, for now Arthur came up and said, \u201cMrs. Poyser, I\u2019m come to request the favour of your hand for the first dance; and, Mr. Poyser, you must let me take you to my aunt, for she claims you as her partner.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The wife\u2019s pale cheek flushed with a nervous sense of unwonted honour as Arthur led her to the top of the room; but Mr. Poyser, to whom an extra glass had restored his youthful confidence in his good looks and good dancing, walked along with them quite proudly, secretly flattering himself that Miss Lydia had never had a partner in ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her")," life who could lift her off the ground as he would. In order to balance the honours given to the two parishes, Miss Irwine danced with Luke Britton, the largest Broxton farmer, and Mr. Gawaine led out Mrs. Britton. Mr. Irwine, after seating his sister Anne, had gone to the abbey gallery, as he had agreed with Arthur beforehand, to see how the merriment of the cottagers was prospering. Meanwhile, all the less distinguished couples had taken their places: Hetty was led out by the inevitable Mr. Craig, and Mary Burge by Adam; and now the music struck up, and the glorious country-dance, best of all dances, began. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Pity it was not a boarded floor! Then the rhythmic stamping of the thick shoes would have been better than any drums. That merry stamping, that gracious nodding of the head, that waving bestowal of the hand\u2014where can we see them now? That simple dancing of well-covered matrons, laying aside for an hour the cares of house and dairy, remembering but not affecting youth, not jealous but proud of the young maidens by their side\u2014that holiday sprightliness of portly husbands paying little compliments to their wives, as if their courting days were come again\u2014those lads and lasses a little confused and awkward with their partners, having nothing to say\u2014it would be a pleasant variety to see all that sometimes, instead of low dresses and large skirts, and scanning glances exploring costumes, and languid men in lacquered boots smiling with double meaning. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  There was but one thing to mar Martin Poyser\u2019s pleasure in this dance: it was that he was always in close contact with Luke Britton, that slovenly farmer. He thought of throwing a little glazed coldness into his eye in the crossing of hands; but then, as Miss Irwine was opposite to him instead of the offensive Luke, he might freeze the wrong person. So he gave his face up to hilarity, unchilled by moral judgments. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  How Hetty\u2019s heart beat as Arthur approached her! He had hardly looked at her to-day: now he ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"must")," take her hand. Would he press it? Would he look at her? She thought she would cry if he gave her no sign of feeling. Now he was there\u2014he had taken her hand\u2014yes, he was pressing it. Hetty turned pale as she looked up at him for an instant and met his eyes, before the dance carried him away. That pale look came upon Arthur like the beginning of a dull pain, which clung to him, though he must dance and smile and joke all the same. Hetty would look so, when he told her what he had to tell her; and he should never be able to bear it\u2014he should be a fool and give way again. Hetty\u2019s look did not really mean so much as he thought: it was only the sign of a struggle between the desire for him to notice her and the dread lest she should betray the desire to others. But Hetty\u2019s face had a language that transcended her feelings. There are faces which nature charges with a meaning and pathos not belonging to the single human soul that flutters beneath them, but speaking the joys and sorrows of foregone generations\u2014eyes that tell of deep love which doubtless has been and is somewhere, but not paired with these eyes\u2014perhaps paired with pale eyes that can say nothing; just as a national language may be instinct with poetry unfelt by the lips that use it. That look of Hetty\u2019s oppressed Arthur with a dread which yet had something of a terrible unconfessed delight in it, that she loved him too well. There was a hard task before him, for at that moment he felt he would have given up three years of his youth for the happiness of abandoning himself without remorse to his passion for Hetty. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  These were the incongruous thoughts in his mind as he led Mrs. Poyser, who was panting with fatigue, and secretly resolving that neither judge nor jury should force her to dance another dance, to take a quiet rest in the dining-room, where supper was laid out for the guests to come and take it as they chose. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ve desired Hetty to remember as she\u2019s got to dance wi\u2019 you, sir,\u201d said the good innocent woman; \u201cfor she\u2019s so thoughtless, she\u2019d be like enough to go an\u2019 engage herself for ivery dance. So I told her not to promise too many.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThank you, Mrs. Poyser,\u201d said Arthur, not without a twinge. \u201cNow, sit down in this comfortable chair, and here is Mills ready to give you what you would like best.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He hurried away to seek another matronly partner, for due honour must be paid to the married women before he asked any of the young ones; and the country-dances, and the stamping, and the gracious nodding, and the waving of the hands, went on joyously. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  At last the time had come for the fourth dance\u2014longed for by the strong, grave Adam, as if he had been a delicate-handed youth of eighteen; for we are all very much alike when we are in our first love; and Adam had hardly ever touched Hetty\u2019s hand for more than a transient greeting\u2014had never danced with her but once before. His eyes had followed her eagerly to-night in spite of himself, and had taken in deeper draughts of love. He thought she behaved so prettily, so quietly; she did not seem to be flirting at all, she smiled less than usual; there was almost a sweet sadness about her. \u201cGod bless her!\u201d he said inwardly; \u201cI\u2019d make her life a happy \u2019un, if a strong arm to work for her, and a heart to love her, could do it.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  And then there stole over him delicious thoughts of coming home from work, and drawing Hetty to his side, and feeling her cheek softly pressed against his, till he forgot where he was, and the music and the tread of feet might have been the falling of rain and the roaring of the wind, for what he knew. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  But now the third dance was ended, and he might go up to her and claim her hand. She was at the far end of the hall near the staircase, whispering with Molly, who had just given the sleeping Totty into her arms before running to fetch shawls and bonnets from the landing. Mrs. Poyser had taken the two boys away into the dining-room to give them some cake before they went home in the cart with Grandfather and Molly was to follow as fast as possible. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet me hold her,\u201d said Adam, as Molly turned upstairs; \u201cthe children are so heavy when they\u2019re asleep.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty was glad of the relief, for to hold Totty in her arms, standing, was not at all a pleasant variety to her. But this second transfer had the unfortunate effect of rousing Totty, who was not behind any child of her age in peevishness at an unseasonable awaking. While Hetty was in the act of placing her in Adam\u2019s arms, and had not yet withdrawn her own, Totty opened her eyes, and forthwith fought out with her left fist at Adam\u2019s arm, and with her right caught at the string of brown beads round Hetty\u2019s neck. The locket leaped out from her frock, and the next moment the string was broken, and Hetty, helpless, saw beads and locket scattered wide on the floor. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMy locket, my locket!\u201d she said, in a loud frightened whisper to Adam; \u201cnever mind the beads.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam had already seen where the locket fell, for it had attracted his glance as it leaped out of her frock. It had fallen on the raised wooden dais where the band sat, not on the stone floor; and as Adam picked it up, he saw the glass with the dark and light locks of hair under it. It had fallen that side upwards, so the glass was not broken. He turned it over on his hand, and saw the enamelled gold back. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt isn\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said, as he held it towards Hetty, who was unable to take it because both her hands were occupied with Totty. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, it doesn\u2019t matter, I don\u2019t mind about it,\u201d said Hetty, who had been pale and was now red. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNot matter?\u201d said Adam, gravely. \u201cYou seemed very frightened about it. I\u2019ll hold it till you\u2019re ready to take it,\u201d he added, quietly closing his hand over it, that she might not think he wanted to look at it again. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  By this time Molly had come with bonnet and shawl, and as soon as she had taken Totty, Adam placed the locket in Hetty\u2019s hand. She took it with an air of indifference and put it in her pocket, in her heart vexed and angry with Adam because he had seen it, but determined now that she would show no more signs of agitation. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSee,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re taking their places to dance; let us go.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam assented silently. A puzzled alarm had taken possession of him. Had Hetty a lover he didn\u2019t know of? For none of her relations, he was sure, would give her a locket like that; and none of her admirers, with whom he was acquainted, was in the position of an accepted lover, as the giver of that locket must be. Adam was lost in the utter impossibility of finding any person for his fears to alight on. He could only feel with a terrible pang that there was something in Hetty\u2019s life unknown to him; that while he had been rocking himself in the hope that she would come to love him, she was already loving another. The pleasure of the dance with Hetty was gone; his eyes, when they rested on her, had an uneasy questioning expression in them; he could think of nothing to say to her; and she too was out of temper and disinclined to speak. They were both glad when the dance was ended. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam was determined to stay no longer; no one wanted him, and no one would notice if he slipped away. As soon as he got out of doors, he began to walk at his habitual rapid pace, hurrying along without knowing why, busy with the painful thought that the memory of this day, so full of honour and promise to him, was poisoned for ever. Suddenly, when he was far on through the Chase, he stopped, startled by a flash of reviving hope. After all, he might be a fool, making a great misery out of a trifle. Hetty, fond of finery as she was, might have bought the thing herself. It looked too expensive for that\u2014it looked like the things on white satin in the great jeweller\u2019s shop at Rosseter. But Adam had very imperfect notions of the value of such things, and he thought it could certainly not cost more than a guinea. Perhaps Hetty had had as much as that in Christmas boxes, and there was no knowing but she might have been childish enough to spend it in that way; she was such a young thing, and she couldn\u2019t help loving finery! But then, why had she been so frightened about it at first, and changed colour so, and afterwards pretended not to care? Oh, that was because she was ashamed of his seeing that she had such a smart thing\u2014she was conscious that it was wrong for her to spend her money on it, and she knew that Adam disapproved of finery. It was a proof she cared about what he liked and disliked. She must have thought from his silence and gravity afterwards that he was very much displeased with her, that he was inclined to be harsh and severe towards her foibles. And as he walked on more quietly, chewing the cud of this new hope, his only uneasiness was that he had behaved in a way which might chill Hetty\u2019s feeling towards him. For this last view of the matter ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"must")," be the true one. How could Hetty have an accepted lover, quite unknown to him? She was never away from her uncle\u2019s house for more than a day; she could have no acquaintances that did not come there, and no intimacies unknown to her uncle and aunt. It would be folly to believe that the locket was given to her by a lover. The little ring of dark hair he felt sure was her own; he could form no guess about the light hair under it, for he had not seen it very distinctly. It might be a bit of her father\u2019s or mother\u2019s, who had died when she was a child, and she would naturally put a bit of her own along with it. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  And so Adam went to bed comforted, having woven for himself an ingenious web of probabilities\u2014the surest screen a wise man can place between himself and the truth. His last waking thoughts melted into a dream that he was with Hetty again at the Hall Farm, and that he was asking her to forgive him for being so cold and silent. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  And while he was dreaming this, Arthur was leading Hetty to the dance and saying to her in low hurried tones, \u201cI shall be in the wood the day after to-morrow at seven; come as early as you can.\u201d And Hetty\u2019s foolish joys and hopes, which had flown away for a little space, scared by a mere nothing, now all came fluttering back, unconscious of the real peril. She was happy for the first time this long day, and wished that dance would last for hours. Arthur wished it too; it was the last weakness he meant to indulge in; and a man never lies with more delicious languor under the influence of a passion than when he has persuaded himself that he shall subdue it to-morrow. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  But Mrs. Poyser\u2019s wishes were quite the reverse of this, for her mind was filled with dreary forebodings as to the retardation of to-morrow morning\u2019s cheese in consequence of these late hours. Now that Hetty had done her duty and danced one dance with the young squire, Mr. Poyser must go out and see if the cart was come back to fetch them, for it was half-past ten o\u2019clock, and notwithstanding a mild suggestion on his part that it would be bad manners for them to be the first to go, Mrs. Poyser was resolute on the point, \u201cmanners or no manners.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat!

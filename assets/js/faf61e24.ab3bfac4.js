It would be easy enough, by the aid of the nicks in the stone pillars, to climb over the brick wall with its smooth stone coping; but by putting our eyes close to the rusty bars of the gate, we can see the house well enough, and all but the very corners of the grassy enclosure. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It is a very fine old place, of red brick, softened by a pale powdery lichen, which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity, so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables, the windows, and the door-place. But the windows are patched with wooden panes, and the door, I think, is like the gate\u2014it is never opened. How it would groan and grate against the stone floor if it were! For it is a solid, heavy, handsome door, and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a sonorous bang behind a liveried lackey, who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But at present one might fancy the house in the early stage of a chancery suit, and that the fruit from that grand double row of walnut-trees on the right hand of the enclosure would fall and rot among the grass, if it were not that we heard the booming bark of dogs echoing from great buildings at the back. And now the half-weaned calves that have been sheltering themselves in a gorse-built hovel against the left-hand wall come out and set up a silly answer to that terrible bark, doubtless supposing that it has reference to buckets of milk. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Yes, the house must be inhabited, and we will see by whom; for imagination is a licensed trespasser: it has no fear of dogs, but may climb over walls and peep in at windows with impunity. Put your face to one of the glass panes in the right-hand window: what do you see? A large open fireplace, with rusty dogs in it, and a bare boarded floor; at the far end, fleeces of wool stacked up; in the middle of the floor, some empty corn-bags. That is the furniture of the dining-room. And what through the left-hand window? Several clothes-horses, a pillion, a spinning-wheel, and an old box wide open and stuffed full of coloured rags. At the edge of this box there lies a great wooden doll, which, so far as mutilation is concerned, bears a strong resemblance to the finest Greek sculpture, and especially in the total loss of its nose. Near it there is a little chair, and the butt end of a boy\u2019s leather long-lashed whip. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The history of the house is plain now. It was once the residence of a country squire, whose family, probably dwindling down to mere spinsterhood, got merged in the more territorial name of Donnithorne. It was once the Hall; it is now the Hall Farm. Like the life in some coast town that was once a watering-place, and is now a port, where the genteel streets are silent and grass-grown, and the docks and warehouses busy and resonant, the life at the Hall has changed its focus, and no longer radiates from the parlour, but from the kitchen and the farmyard. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Plenty of life there, though this is the drowsiest time of the year, just before hay-harvest; and it is the drowsiest time of the day too, for it is close upon three by the sun, and it is half-past three by Mrs. Poyser\u2019s handsome eight-day clock. But there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain; and now he is pouring down his beams, and making sparkles among the wet straw, and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow-shed, and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow-billed ducks, who are seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as possible. There is quite a concert of noises; the great bull-dog, chained against the stables, is thrown into furious exasperation by the unwary approach of a cock too near the mouth of his kennel, and sends forth a thundering bark, which is answered by two fox-hounds shut up in the opposite cow-house; the old top-knotted hens, scratching with their chicks among the straw, set up a sympathetic croaking as the discomfited cock joins them; a sow with her brood, all very muddy as to the legs, and curled as to the tail, throws in some deep staccato notes; our friends the calves are bleating from the home croft; and, under all, a fine ear discerns the continuous hum of human voices. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  For the great barn-doors are thrown wide open, and men are busy there mending the harness, under the superintendence of Mr. Goby, the \u201cwhittaw,\u201d otherwise saddler, who entertains them with the latest Treddleston gossip. It is certainly rather an unfortunate day that Alick, the shepherd, has chosen for having the whittaws, since the morning turned out so wet; and Mrs. Poyser has spoken her mind pretty strongly as to the dirt which the extra number of men\u2019s shoes brought into the house at dinnertime. Indeed, she has not yet recovered her equanimity on the subject, though it is now nearly three hours since dinner, and the house-floor is perfectly clean again; as clean as everything else in that wonderful house-place, where the only chance of collecting a few grains of dust would be to climb on the salt-coffer, and put your finger on the high mantel-shelf on which the glittering brass candlesticks are enjoying their summer sinecure; for at this time of year, of course, every one goes to bed while it is yet light, or at least light enough to discern the outline of objects after you have bruised your shins against them. Surely nowhere else could an oak clock-case and an oak table have got to such a polish by the hand: genuine \u201celbow polish,\u201d as Mrs. Poyser called it, for she thanked God she never had any of your varnished rubbish in her house. Hetty Sorrel often took the opportunity, when her aunt\u2019s back was turned, of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished surfaces, for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen, and was more for ornament than for use; and she could see herself sometimes in the great round pewter dishes that were ranged on the shelves above the long deal dinner-table, or in the hobs of the grate, which always shone like jasper. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Everything was looking at its brightest at this moment, for the sun shone right on the pewter dishes, and from their reflecting surfaces pleasant jets of light were thrown on mellow oak and bright brass\u2014and on a still pleasanter object than these, for some of the rays fell on Dinah\u2019s finely moulded cheek, and lit up her pale red hair to auburn, as she bent over the heavy household linen which she was mending for her aunt. No scene could have been more peaceful, if Mrs. Poyser, who was ironing a few things that still remained from the Monday\u2019s wash, had not been making a frequent clinking with her iron and moving to and fro whenever she wanted it to cool; carrying the keen glance of her blue-grey eye from the kitchen to the dairy, where Hetty was making up the butter, and from the dairy to the back kitchen, where Nancy was taking the pies out of the oven. Do not suppose, however, that Mrs. Poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance; she was a good-looking woman, not more than eight-and-thirty, of fair complexion and sandy hair, well-shapen, light-footed. The most conspicuous article in her attire was an ample checkered linen apron, which almost covered her skirt; and nothing could be plainer or less noticeable than her cap and gown, for there was no weakness of which she was less tolerant than feminine vanity, and the preference of ornament to utility. The family likeness between her and her niece Dinah Morris, with the contrast between her keenness and Dinah\u2019s seraphic gentleness of expression, might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and Mary. Their eyes were just of the same colour, but a striking test of the difference in their operation was seen in the demeanour of Trip, the black-and-tan terrier, whenever that much-suspected dog unwarily exposed himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs. Poyser\u2019s glance. Her tongue was not less keen than her eye, and, whenever a damsel came within earshot, seemed to take up an unfinished lecture, as a barrel-organ takes up a tune, precisely at the point where it had left off. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The fact that it was churning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the whittaws, and why, consequently, Mrs. Poyser should scold Molly the housemaid with unusual severity. To all appearance Molly had got through her after-dinner work in an exemplary manner, had \u201ccleaned herself\u201d with great dispatch, and now came to ask, submissively, if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time. But this blameless conduct, according to Mrs. Poyser, shrouded a secret indulgence of unbecoming wishes, which she now dragged forth and held up to Molly\u2019s view with cutting eloquence. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSpinning, indeed! It isn\u2019t spinning as you\u2019d be at, I\u2019ll be bound, and let you have your own way. I never knew your equals for gallowsness. To think of a gell o\u2019 your age wanting to go and sit with half-a-dozen men! I\u2019d ha\u2019 been ashamed to let the words pass over my lips if I\u2019d been you.

Why, you\u2019d leave the dirt in heaps i\u2019 the corners\u2014anybody \u2019ud think you\u2019d never been brought up among Christians. And as for spinning, why, you\u2019ve wasted as much as your wage i\u2019 the flax you\u2019ve spoiled learning to spin. And you\u2019ve a right to feel that, and not to go about as gaping and as thoughtless as if you was beholding to nobody. Comb the wool for the whittaws, indeed! That\u2019s what you\u2019d like to be doing, is it? That\u2019s the way with you\u2014that\u2019s the road you\u2019d all like to go, headlongs to ruin. You\u2019re never easy till you\u2019ve got some sweetheart as is as big a fool as yourself: you think you\u2019ll be finely off when you\u2019re married, I daresay, and have got a three-legged stool to sit on, and never a blanket to cover you, and a bit o\u2019 oat-cake for your dinner, as three children are a-snatching at.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m sure I donna want t\u2019 go wi\u2019 the whittaws,\u201d said Molly, whimpering, and quite overcome by this Dantean picture of her future, \u201con\u2019y we allays used to comb the wool for \u2019n at Mester Ottley\u2019s; an\u2019 so I just axed ye.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The starch having been wiped up by Molly\u2019s help, and the ironing apparatus put by, Mrs. Poyser took up her knitting which always lay ready at hand, and was the work she liked best, because she could carry it on automatically as she walked to and fro. But now she came and sat down opposite Dinah, whom she looked at in a meditative way, as she knitted her grey worsted stocking. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou look th\u2019 image o\u2019 your Aunt Judith, Dinah, when you sit a-sewing. I could almost fancy it was thirty years back, and I was a little gell at home, looking at Judith as she sat at her work, after she\u2019d done the house up; only it was a little cottage, Father\u2019s was, and not a big rambling house as gets dirty i\u2019 one corner as fast as you clean it in another\u2014but for all that, I could fancy you was your Aunt Judith, only her hair was a deal darker than yours, and she was stouter and broader i\u2019 the shoulders. Judith and me allays hung together, though she had such queer ways, but your mother and her never could agree. Ah, your mother little thought as she\u2019d have a daughter just cut out after the very pattern o\u2019 Judith, and leave her an orphan, too, for Judith to take care on, and bring up with a spoon when ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"she")," was in the graveyard at Stoniton. I allays said that o\u2019 Judith, as she\u2019d bear a pound weight any day to save anybody else carrying a ounce. And she was just the same from the first o\u2019 my remembering her; it made no difference in her, as I could see, when she took to the Methodists, only she talked a bit different and wore a different sort o\u2019 cap; but she\u2019d never in her life spent a penny on herself more than keeping herself decent.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cShe was a blessed woman,\u201d said Dinah; \u201cGod had given her a loving, self-forgetting nature, and He perfected it by grace. And she was very fond of you too, Aunt Rachel. I often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way. When she had that bad illness, and I was only eleven years old, she used to say, \u2018You\u2019ll have a friend on earth in your Aunt Rachel, if I\u2019m taken from you, for she has a kind heart,\u2019 and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve found it so.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI don\u2019t know how, child; anybody \u2019ud be cunning to do anything for you, I think; you\u2019re like the birds o\u2019 th\u2019 air, and live nobody knows how. I\u2019d ha\u2019 been glad to behave to you like a mother\u2019s sister, if you\u2019d come and live i\u2019 this country where there\u2019s some shelter and victual for man and beast, and folks don\u2019t live on the naked hills, like poultry a-scratching on a gravel bank. And then you might get married to some decent man, and there\u2019d be plenty ready to have you, if you\u2019d only leave off that preaching, as is ten times worse than anything your Aunt Judith ever did. And even if you\u2019d marry Seth Bede, as is a poor wool-gathering Methodist and\u2019s never like to have a penny beforehand, I know your uncle \u2019ud help you with a pig, and very like a cow, for he\u2019s allays been good-natur\u2019d to my kin, for all they\u2019re poor, and made \u2019em welcome to the house; and \u2019ud do for you, I\u2019ll be bound, as much as ever he\u2019d do for Hetty, though she\u2019s his own niece.

It\u2019s quite right the land should be ploughed and sowed, and the precious corn stored, and the things of this life cared for, and right that people should rejoice in their families, and provide for them, so that this is done in the fear of the Lord, and that they are not unmindful of the soul\u2019s wants while they are caring for the body. We can all be servants of God wherever our lot is cast, but He gives us different sorts of work, according as He fits us for it and calls us to it. I can no more help spending my life in trying to do what I can for the souls of others, than you could help running if you heard little Totty crying at the other end of the house; the voice would go to your heart, you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger, and you couldn\u2019t rest without running to help her and comfort her.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser, rising and walking towards the door, \u201cI know it \u2019ud be just the same if I was to talk to you for hours. You\u2019d make me the same answer, at th\u2019 end. I might as well talk to the running brook and tell it to stan\u2019 still.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The causeway outside the kitchen door was dry enough now for Mrs. Poyser to stand there quite pleasantly and see what was going on in the yard, the grey worsted stocking making a steady progress in her hands all the while. But she had not been standing there more than five minutes before she came in again, and said to Dinah, in rather a flurried, awe-stricken tone, \u201cIf there isn\u2019t Captain Donnithorne and Mr. Irwine a-coming into the yard! I\u2019ll lay my life they\u2019re come to speak about your preaching on the Green, Dinah; it\u2019s you must answer \u2019em, for I\u2019m dumb. I\u2019ve said enough a\u2019ready about your bringing such disgrace upo\u2019 your uncle\u2019s family. I wouldn\u2019t ha\u2019 minded if you\u2019d been Mr. Poyser\u2019s own niece\u2014folks must put up wi\u2019 their own kin, as they put up wi\u2019 their own noses\u2014it\u2019s their own flesh and blood. But to think of a niece o\u2019 mine being cause o\u2019 my husband\u2019s being turned out of his farm, and me brought him no fortin but my savin\u2019s\u2014\u2014\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, dear Aunt Rachel,\u201d said Dinah gently, \u201cyou\u2019ve no cause for such fears. I\u2019ve strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children from anything I\u2019ve done. I didn\u2019t preach without direction.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDirection! I know very well what you mean by direction,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser, knitting in a rapid and agitated manner. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a bigger maggot than usual in your head you call it \u2018direction\u2019; and then nothing can stir you\u2014you look like the statty o\u2019 the outside o\u2019 Treddles\u2019on church, a-starin\u2019 and a-smilin\u2019 whether it\u2019s fair weather or foul. I hanna common patience with you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  By this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from their horses: it was plain they meant to come in. Mrs. Poyser advanced to the door to meet them, curtsying low and trembling between anger with Dinah and anxiety to conduct herself with perfect propriety on the occasion. For in those days the keenest of bucolic minds felt a whispering awe at the sight of the gentry, such as of old men felt when they stood on tiptoe to watch the gods passing by in tall human shape. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, Mrs. Poyser, how are you after this stormy morning?\u201d said Mr. Irwine, with his stately cordiality. \u201cOur feet are quite dry; we shall not soil your beautiful floor.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, sir, don\u2019t mention it,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser. \u201cWill you and the captain please to walk into the parlour?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, indeed, thank you, Mrs. Poyser,\u201d said the captain, looking eagerly round the kitchen, as if his eye were seeking something it could not find. \u201cI delight in your kitchen. I think it is the most charming room I know. I should like every farmer\u2019s wife to come and look at it for a pattern.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, you\u2019re pleased to say so, sir. Pray take a seat,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser, relieved a little by this compliment and the captain\u2019s evident good-humour, but still glancing anxiously at Mr. Irwine, who, she saw, was looking at Dinah and advancing towards her. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cPoyser is not at home, is he?\u201d said Captain Donnithorne, seating himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy-door. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, sir, he isn\u2019t; he\u2019s gone to Rosseter to see Mr. West, the factor, about the wool. But there\u2019s Father i\u2019 the barn, sir, if he\u2019d be of any use.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, thank you; I\u2019ll just look at the whelps and leave a message about them with your shepherd. I must come another day and see your husband; I want to have a consultation with him about horses. Do you know when he\u2019s likely to be at liberty?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, sir, you can hardly miss him, except it\u2019s o\u2019 Treddles\u2019on market-day\u2014that\u2019s of a Friday, you know. For if he\u2019s anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute. If we\u2019d got rid o\u2019 the Scantlands, we should have no outlying fields; and I should be glad of it, for if ever anything happens, he\u2019s sure to be gone to the Scantlands. Things allays happen so contrairy, if they\u2019ve a chance; and it\u2019s an unnat\u2019ral thing to have one bit o\u2019 your farm in one county and all the rest in another.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, the Scantlands would go much better with Choyce\u2019s farm, especially as he wants dairyland and you\u2019ve got plenty. I think yours is the prettiest farm on the estate, though; and do you know, Mrs. Poyser, if I were going to marry and settle, I should be tempted to turn you out, and do up this fine old house, and turn farmer myself.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser, rather alarmed, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t like it at all. As for farming, it\u2019s putting money into your pocket wi\u2019 your right hand and fetching it out wi\u2019 your left. As fur as I can see, it\u2019s raising victual for other folks and just getting a mouthful for yourself and your children as you go along. Not as you\u2019d be like a poor man as wants to get his bread\u2014you could afford to lose as much money as you liked i\u2019 farming\u2014but it\u2019s poor fun losing money, I should think, though I understan\u2019 it\u2019s what the great folks i\u2019 London play at more than anything. For my husband heard at market as Lord Dacey\u2019s eldest son had lost thousands upo\u2019 thousands to the Prince o\u2019 Wales, and they said my lady was going to pawn her jewels to pay for him. But you know more about that than I do, sir. But, as for farming, sir, I canna think as you\u2019d like it; and this house\u2014the draughts in it are enough to cut you through, and it\u2019s my opinion the floors upstairs are very rotten, and the rats i\u2019 the cellar are beyond anything.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, that\u2019s a terrible picture, Mrs. Poyser. I think I should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place. But there\u2019s no chance of that. I\u2019m not likely to settle for the next twenty years, till I\u2019m a stout gentleman of forty; and my grandfather would never consent to part with such good tenants as you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, sir, if he thinks so well o\u2019 Mr. Poyser for a tenant I wish you could put in a word for him to allow us some new gates for the Five closes, for my husband\u2019s been asking and asking till he\u2019s tired, and to think o\u2019 what he\u2019s done for the farm, and\u2019s never had a penny allowed him, be the times bad or good. And as I\u2019ve said to my husband often and often, I\u2019m sure if the captain had anything to do with it, it wouldn\u2019t be so. Not as I wish to speak disrespectful o\u2019 them as have got the power i\u2019 their hands, but it\u2019s more than flesh and blood \u2019ull bear sometimes, to be toiling and striving, and up early and down late, and hardly sleeping a wink when you lie down for thinking as the cheese may swell, or the cows may slip their calf, or the wheat may grow green again i\u2019 the sheaf\u2014and after all, at th\u2019 end o\u2019 the year, it\u2019s like as if you\u2019d been cooking a feast and had got the smell of it for your pains.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs. Poyser, once launched into conversation, always sailed along without any check from her preliminary awe of the gentry. The confidence she felt in her own powers of exposition was a motive force that overcame all resistance. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m afraid I should only do harm instead of good, if I were to speak about the gates, Mrs. Poyser,\u201d said the captain, \u201cthough I assure you there\u2019s no man on the estate I would sooner say a word for than your husband. I know his farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us; and as for the kitchen,\u201d he added, smiling, \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s one in the kingdom to beat it. By the by, I\u2019ve never seen your dairy: I must see your dairy, Mrs. Poyser.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIndeed, sir, it\u2019s not fit for you to go in, for Hetty\u2019s in the middle o\u2019 making the butter, for the churning was thrown late, and I\u2019m quite ashamed.\u201d This Mrs. Poyser said blushing, and believing that the captain was really interested in her milk-pans, and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, I\u2019ve no doubt it\u2019s in capital order. Take me in,\u201d said the captain, himself leading the way, while Mrs. Poyser followed."))}y.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

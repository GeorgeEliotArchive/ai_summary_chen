The rector, he knows, breakfasts alone at half-past nine, the ladies of the family having a different breakfast-hour; Arthur will have an early ride over the hill and breakfast with him. One can say everything best over a meal. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The progress of civilization has made a breakfast or a dinner an easy and cheerful substitute for more troublesome and disagreeable ceremonies. We take a less gloomy view of our errors now our father confessor listens to us over his egg and coffee. We are more distinctly conscious that rude penances are out of the question for gentlemen in an enlightened age, and that mortal sin is not incompatible with an appetite for muffins. An assault on our pockets, which in more barbarous times would have been made in the brusque form of a pistol-shot, is quite a well-bred and smiling procedure now it has become a request for a loan thrown in as an easy parenthesis between the second and third glasses of claret. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Still, there was this advantage in the old rigid forms, that they committed you to the fulfilment of a resolution by some outward deed: when you have put your mouth to one end of a hole in a stone wall and are aware that there is an expectant ear at the other end, you are more likely to say what you came out with the intention of saying than if you were seated with your legs in an easy attitude under the mahogany with a companion who will have no reason to be surprised if you have nothing particular to say. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  However, Arthur Donnithorne, as he winds among the pleasant lanes on horseback in the morning sunshine, has a sincere determination to open his heart to the rector, and the swirling sound of the scythe as he passes by the meadow is all the pleasanter to him because of this honest purpose. He is glad to see the promise of settled weather now, for getting in the hay, about which the farmers have been fearful; and there is something so healthful in the sharing of a joy that is general and not merely personal, that this thought about the hay-harvest reacts on his state of mind and makes his resolution seem an easier matter. A man about town might perhaps consider that these influences were not to be felt out of a child\u2019s story-book; but when you are among the fields and hedgerows, it is impossible to maintain a consistent superiority to simple natural pleasures. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur had passed the village of Hayslope and was approaching the Broxton side of the hill, when, at a turning in the road, he saw a figure about a hundred yards before him which it was impossible to mistake for any one else than Adam Bede, even if there had been no grey, tailless shepherd-dog at his heels. He was striding along at his usual rapid pace, and Arthur pushed on his horse to overtake him, for he retained too much of his boyish feeling for Adam to miss an opportunity of chatting with him. I will not say that his love for that good fellow did not owe some of its force to the love of patronage: our friend Arthur liked to do everything that was handsome, and to have his handsome deeds recognized. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam looked round as he heard the quickening clatter of the horse\u2019s heels, and waited for the horseman, lifting his paper cap from his head with a bright smile of recognition. Next to his own brother Seth, Adam would have done more for Arthur Donnithorne than for any other young man in the world. There was hardly anything he would not rather have lost than the two-feet ruler which he always carried in his pocket; it was Arthur\u2019s present, bought with his pocket-money when he was a fair-haired lad of eleven, and when he had profited so well by Adam\u2019s lessons in carpentering and turning as to embarrass every female in the house with gifts of superfluous thread-reels and round boxes. Adam had quite a pride in the little squire in those early days, and the feeling had only become slightly modified as the fair-haired lad had grown into the whiskered young man. Adam, I confess, was very susceptible to the influence of rank, and quite ready to give an extra amount of respect to every one who had more advantages than himself, not being a philosopher or a proletaire with democratic ideas, but simply a stout-limbed clever carpenter with a large fund of reverence in his nature, which inclined him to admit all established claims unless he saw very clear grounds for questioning them. He had no theories about setting the world to rights, but he saw there was a great deal of damage done by building with ill-seasoned timber\u2014by ignorant men in fine clothes making plans for outhouses and workshops and the like without knowing the bearings of things\u2014by slovenly joiners\u2019 work, and by hasty contracts that could never be fulfilled without ruining somebody; and he resolved, for his part, to set his face against such doings. On these points he would have maintained his opinion against the largest landed proprietor in Loamshire or Stonyshire either; but he felt that beyond these it would be better for him to defer to people who were more knowing than himself. He saw as plainly as possible how ill the woods on the estate were managed, and the shameful state of the farm-buildings; and if old Squire Donnithorne had asked him the effect of this mismanagement, he would have spoken his opinion without flinching, but the impulse to a respectful demeanour towards a \u201cgentleman\u201d would have been strong within him all the while. The word \u201cgentleman\u201d had a spell for Adam, and, as he often said, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t abide a fellow who thought he made himself fine by being coxy to\u2019s betters.\u201d I must remind you again that Adam had the blood of the peasant in his veins, and that since he was in his prime half a century ago, you must expect some of his characteristics to be obsolete. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Towards the young squire this instinctive reverence of Adam\u2019s was assisted by boyish memories and personal regard so you may imagine that he thought far more of Arthur\u2019s good qualities, and attached far more value to very slight actions of his, than if they had been the qualities and actions of a common workman like himself. He felt sure it would be a fine day for everybody about Hayslope when the young squire came into the estate\u2014such a generous open-hearted disposition as he had, and an \u201cuncommon\u201d notion about improvements and repairs, considering he was only just coming of age. Thus there was both respect and affection in the smile with which he raised his paper cap as Arthur Donnithorne rode up. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, Adam, how are you?\u201d said Arthur, holding out his hand. He never shook hands with any of the farmers, and Adam felt the honour keenly. \u201cI could swear to your back a long way off. It\u2019s just the same back, only broader, as when you used to carry me on it. Do you remember?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAye, sir, I remember. It \u2019ud be a poor look-out if folks didn\u2019t remember what they did and said when they were lads. We should think no more about old friends than we do about new uns, then.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019re going to Broxton, I suppose?\u201d said Arthur, putting his horse on at a slow pace while Adam walked by his side. \u201cAre you going to the rectory?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, sir, I\u2019m going to see about Bradwell\u2019s barn. They\u2019re afraid of the roof pushing the walls out, and I\u2019m going to see what can be done with it before we send the stuff and the workmen.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, Burge trusts almost everything to you now, Adam, doesn\u2019t he? I should think he will make you his partner soon. He will, if he\u2019s wise.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, sir, I don\u2019t see as he\u2019d be much the better off for that. A foreman, if he\u2019s got a conscience and delights in his work, will do his business as well as if he was a partner. I wouldn\u2019t give a penny for a man as \u2019ud drive a nail in slack because he didn\u2019t get extra pay for it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI know that, Adam; I know you work for him as well as if you were working for yourself. But you would have more power than you have now, and could turn the business to better account perhaps. The old man must give up his business sometime, and he has no son; I suppose he\u2019ll want a son-in-law who can take to it. But he has rather grasping fingers of his own, I fancy. I daresay he wants a man who can put some money into the business. If I were not as poor as a rat, I would gladly invest some money in that way, for the sake of having you settled on the estate. I\u2019m sure I should profit by it in the end. And perhaps I shall be better off in a year or two. I shall have a larger allowance now I\u2019m of age; and when I\u2019ve paid off a debt or two, I shall be able to look about me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019re very good to say so, sir, and I\u2019m not unthankful. But\u201d\u2014Adam continued, in a decided tone\u2014\u201cI shouldn\u2019t like to make any offers to Mr. Burge, or t\u2019 have any made for me. I see no clear road to a partnership. If he should ever want to dispose of the business, that \u2019ud be a different matter. I should be glad of some money at a fair interest then, for I feel sure I could pay it off in time.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cVery well, Adam,\u201d said Arthur, remembering what Mr. Irwine had said about a probable hitch in the love-making between Adam and Mary Burge, \u201cwe\u2019ll say no more about it at present. When is your father to be buried?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOn Sunday, sir; Mr. Irwine\u2019s coming earlier on purpose. I shall be glad when it\u2019s over, for I think my mother \u2019ull perhaps get easier then. It cuts one sadly to see the grief of old people; they\u2019ve no way o\u2019 working it off, and the new spring brings no new shoots out on the withered tree.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, you\u2019ve had a good deal of trouble and vexation in your life, Adam. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever been hare-brained and light-hearted, like other youngsters. You\u2019ve always had some care on your mind.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, yes, sir; but that\u2019s nothing to make a fuss about. If we\u2019re men and have men\u2019s feelings, I reckon we must have men\u2019s troubles. We can\u2019t be like the birds, as fly from their nest as soon as they\u2019ve got their wings, and never know their kin when they see \u2019em, and get a fresh lot every year. I\u2019ve had enough to be thankful for: I\u2019ve allays had health and strength and brains to give me a delight in my work; and I count it a great thing as I\u2019ve had Bartle Massey\u2019s night-school to go to. He\u2019s helped me to knowledge I could never ha\u2019 got by myself.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat a rare fellow you are, Adam!\u201d said Arthur, after a pause, in which he had looked musingly at the big fellow walking by his side. \u201cI could hit out better than most men at Oxford, and yet I believe you would knock me into next week if I were to have a battle with you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGod forbid I should ever do that, sir,\u201d said Adam, looking round at Arthur and smiling. \u201cI used to fight for fun, but I\u2019ve never done that since I was the cause o\u2019 poor Gil Tranter being laid up for a fortnight. I\u2019ll never fight any man again, only when he behaves like a scoundrel. If you get hold of a chap that\u2019s got no shame nor conscience to stop him, you must try what you can do by bunging his eyes up.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur did not laugh, for he was preoccupied with some thought that made him say presently, \u201cI should think now, Adam, you never have any struggles within yourself. I fancy you would master a wish that you had made up your mind it was not quite right to indulge, as easily as you would knock down a drunken fellow who was quarrelsome with you. I mean, you are never shilly-shally, first making up your mind that you won\u2019t do a thing, and then doing it after all?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d said Adam, slowly, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, \u201cno. I don\u2019t remember ever being see-saw in that way, when I\u2019d made my mind up, as you say, that a thing was wrong. It takes the taste out o\u2019 my mouth for things, when I know I should have a heavy conscience after \u2019em. I\u2019ve seen pretty clear, ever since I could cast up a sum, as you can never do what\u2019s wrong without breeding sin and trouble more than you can ever see. It\u2019s like a bit o\u2019 bad workmanship\u2014you never see th\u2019 end o\u2019 the mischief it\u2019ll do. And it\u2019s a poor look-out to come into the world to make your fellow-creatures worse off instead o\u2019 better. But there\u2019s a difference between the things folks call wrong. I\u2019m not for making a sin of every little fool\u2019s trick, or bit o\u2019 nonsense anybody may be let into, like some o\u2019 them dissenters. And a man may have two minds whether it isn\u2019t worthwhile to get a bruise or two for the sake of a bit o\u2019 fun. But it isn\u2019t my way to be see-saw about anything: I think my fault lies th\u2019 other way. When I\u2019ve said a thing, if it\u2019s only to myself, it\u2019s hard for me to go back.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, that\u2019s just what I expected of you,\u201d said Arthur. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an iron will, as well as an iron arm. But however strong a man\u2019s resolution may be, it costs him something to carry it out, now and then. We may determine not to gather any cherries and keep our hands sturdily in our pockets, but we can\u2019t prevent our mouths from watering.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat\u2019s true, sir, but there\u2019s nothing like settling with ourselves as there\u2019s a deal we must do without i\u2019 this life. It\u2019s no use looking on life as if it was Treddles\u2019on Fair, where folks only go to see shows and get fairings. If we do, we shall find it different. But where\u2019s the use o\u2019 me talking to you, sir? You know better than I do.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m not so sure of that, Adam. You\u2019ve had four or five years of experience more than I\u2019ve had, and I think your life has been a better school to you than college has been to me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, sir, you seem to think o\u2019 college something like what Bartle Massey does. He says college mostly makes people like bladders\u2014just good for nothing but t\u2019 hold the stuff as is poured into \u2019em. But he\u2019s got a tongue like a sharp blade, Bartle has\u2014it never touches anything but it cuts. Here\u2019s the turning, sir. I must bid you good-morning, as you\u2019re going to the rectory.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGood-bye, Adam, good-bye.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur gave his horse to the groom at the rectory gate, and walked along the gravel towards the door which opened on the garden. He knew that the rector always breakfasted in his study, and the study lay on the left hand of this door, opposite the dining-room. It was a small low room, belonging to the old part of the house\u2014dark with the sombre covers of the books that lined the walls; yet it looked very cheery this morning as Arthur reached the open window. For the morning sun fell aslant on the great glass globe with gold fish in it, which stood on a scagliola pillar in front of the ready-spread bachelor breakfast-table, and by the side of this breakfast-table was a group which would have made any room enticing. In the crimson damask easy-chair sat Mr. Irwine, with that radiant freshness which he always had when he came from his morning toilet; his finely formed plump white hand was playing along Juno\u2019s brown curly back; and close to Juno\u2019s tail, which was wagging with calm matronly pleasure, the two brown pups were rolling over each other in an ecstatic duet of worrying noises. On a cushion a little removed sat Pug, with the air of a maiden lady, who looked on these familiarities as animal weaknesses, which she made as little show as possible of observing. On the table, at Mr. Irwine\u2019s elbow, lay the first volume of the Foulis \xc6schylus, which Arthur knew well by sight; and the silver coffee-pot, which Carroll was bringing in, sent forth a fragrant steam which completed the delights of a bachelor breakfast. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHallo, Arthur, that\u2019s a good fellow! You\u2019re just in time,\u201d said Mr. Irwine, as Arthur paused and stepped in over the low window-sill. \u201cCarroll, we shall want more coffee and eggs, and haven\u2019t you got some cold fowl for us to eat with that ham? Why, this is like old days, Arthur; you haven\u2019t been to breakfast with me these five years.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt was a tempting morning for a ride before breakfast,\u201d said Arthur; \u201cand I used to like breakfasting with you so when I was reading with you. My grandfather is always a few degrees colder at breakfast than at any other hour in the day. I think his morning bath doesn\u2019t agree with him.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur was anxious not to imply that he came with any special purpose. He had no sooner found himself in Mr. Irwine\u2019s presence than the confidence which he had thought quite easy before, suddenly appeared the most difficult thing in the world to him, and at the very moment of shaking hands he saw his purpose in quite a new light. How could he make Irwine understand his position unless he told him those little scenes in the wood; and how could he tell them without looking like a fool? And then his weakness in coming back from Gawaine\u2019s, and doing the very opposite of what he intended! Irwine would think him a shilly-shally fellow ever after. However, it must come out in an unpremeditated way; the conversation might lead up to it. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI like breakfast-time better than any other moment in the day,\u201d said Mr. Irwine. \u201cNo dust has settled on one\u2019s mind then, and it presents a clear mirror to the rays of things. I always have a favourite book by me at breakfast, and I enjoy the bits I pick up then so much, that regularly every morning it seems to me as if I should certainly become studious again. But presently Dent brings up a poor fellow who has killed a hare, and when I\u2019ve got through my \u2018justicing,\u2019 as Carroll calls it, I\u2019m inclined for a ride round the glebe, and on my way back I meet with the master of the workhouse, who has got a long story of a mutinous pauper to tell me; and so the day goes on, and I\u2019m always the same lazy fellow before evening sets in. Besides, one wants the stimulus of sympathy, and I have never had that since poor D\u2019Oyley left Treddleston. If you had stuck to your books well, you rascal, I should have had a pleasanter prospect before me. But scholarship doesn\u2019t run in your family blood.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo indeed. It\u2019s well if I can remember a little inapplicable Latin to adorn my maiden speech in Parliament six or seven years hence. \u2018Cras ingens iterabimus aequor,\u2019 and a few shreds of that sort, will perhaps stick to me, and I shall arrange my opinions so as to introduce them. But I don\u2019t think a knowledge of the classics is a pressing want to a country gentleman; as far as I can see, he\u2019d much better have a knowledge of manures. I\u2019ve been reading your friend Arthur Young\u2019s books lately, and there\u2019s nothing I should like better than to carry out some of his ideas in putting the farmers on a better management of their land; and, as he says, making what was a wild country, all of the same dark hue, bright and variegated with corn and cattle. My grandfather will never let me have any power while he lives, but there\u2019s nothing I should like better than to undertake the Stonyshire side of the estate\u2014it\u2019s in a dismal condition\u2014and set improvements on foot, and gallop about from one place to another and overlook them. I should like to know all the labourers, and see them touching their hats to me with a look of goodwill.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBravo, Arthur! A man who has no feeling for the classics couldn\u2019t make a better apology for coming into the world than by increasing the quantity of food to maintain scholars\u2014and rectors who appreciate scholars. And whenever you enter on your career of model landlord may I be there to see. You\u2019ll want a portly rector to complete the picture, and take his tithe of all the respect and honour you get by your hard work. Only don\u2019t set your heart too strongly on the goodwill you are to get in consequence. I\u2019m not sure that men are the fondest of those who try to be useful to them. You know Gawaine has got the curses of the whole neighbourhood upon him about that enclosure. You must make it quite clear to your mind which you are most bent upon, old boy\u2014popularity or usefulness\u2014else you may happen to miss both.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh! Gawaine is harsh in his manners; he doesn\u2019t make himself personally agreeable to his tenants. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything you can\u2019t prevail on people to do with kindness. For my part, I couldn\u2019t live in a neighbourhood where I was not respected and beloved. And it\u2019s very pleasant to go among the tenants here\u2014they seem all so well inclined to me I suppose it seems only the other day to them since I was a little lad, riding on a pony about as big as a sheep. And if fair allowances were made to them, and their buildings attended to, one could persuade them to farm on a better plan, stupid as they are.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThen mind you fall in love in the right place, and don\u2019t get a wife who will drain your purse and make you niggardly in spite of yourself. My mother and I have a little discussion about you sometimes: she says, \u2018I\u2019ll never risk a single prophecy on Arthur until I see the woman he falls in love with.\u2019 She thinks your lady-love will rule you as the moon rules the tides. But I feel bound to stand up for you, as my pupil you know, and I maintain that you\u2019re not of that watery quality. So mind you don\u2019t disgrace my judgment.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur winced under this speech, for keen old Mrs. Irwine\u2019s opinion about him had the disagreeable effect of a sinister omen. This, to be sure, was only another reason for persevering in his intention, and getting an additional security against himself. Nevertheless, at this point in the conversation, he was conscious of increased disinclination to tell his story about Hetty. He was of an impressible nature, and lived a great deal in other people\u2019s opinions and feelings concerning himself; and the mere fact that he was in the presence of an intimate friend, who had not the slightest notion that he had had any such serious internal struggle as he came to confide, rather shook his own belief in the seriousness of the struggle. It was not, after all, a thing to make a fuss about; and what could Irwine do for him that he could not do for himself? He would go to Eagledale in spite of Meg\u2019s lameness\u2014go on Rattler, and let Pym follow as well as he could on the old hack. That was his thought as he sugared his coffee; but the next minute, as he was lifting the cup to his lips, he remembered how thoroughly he had made up his mind last night to tell Irwine. No! He would not be vacillating again\u2014he ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"would")," do what he had meant to do, this time. So it would be well not to let the personal tone of the conversation altogether drop. If they went to quite indifferent topics, his difficulty would be heightened. It had required no noticeable pause for this rush and rebound of feeling, before he answered, \u201cBut I think it is hardly an argument against a man\u2019s general strength of character that he should be apt to be mastered by love. A fine constitution doesn\u2019t insure one against smallpox or any other of those inevitable diseases. A man may be very firm in other matters and yet be under a sort of witchery from a woman.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes; but there\u2019s this difference between love and smallpox, or bewitchment either\u2014that if you detect the disease at an early stage and try change of air, there is every chance of complete escape without any further development of symptoms. And there are certain alternative doses which a man may administer to himself by keeping unpleasant consequences before his mind: this gives you a sort of smoked glass through which you may look at the resplendent fair one and discern her true outline; though I\u2019m afraid, by the by, the smoked glass is apt to be missing just at the moment it is most wanted. I daresay, now, even a man fortified with a knowledge of the classics might be lured into an imprudent marriage, in spite of the warning given him by the chorus in the Prometheus.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The smile that flitted across Arthur\u2019s face was a faint one, and instead of following Mr. Irwine\u2019s playful lead, he said, quite seriously\u2014\u201cYes, that\u2019s the worst of it. It\u2019s a desperately vexatious thing, that after all one\u2019s reflections and quiet determinations, we should be ruled by moods that one can\u2019t calculate on beforehand. I don\u2019t think a man ought to be blamed so much if he is betrayed into doing things in that way, in spite of his resolutions.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, but the moods lie in his nature, my boy, just as much as his reflections did, and more. A man can never do anything at variance with his own nature. He carries within him the germ of his most exceptional action; and if we wise people make eminent fools of ourselves on any particular occasion, we must endure the legitimate conclusion that we carry a few grains of folly to our ounce of wisdom.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, but one may be betrayed into doing things by a combination of circumstances, which one might never have done otherwise.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, yes, a man can\u2019t very well steal a bank-note unless the bank-note lies within convenient reach; but he won\u2019t make us think him an honest man because he begins to howl at the bank-note for falling in his way.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut surely you don\u2019t think a man who struggles against a temptation into which he falls at last as bad as the man who never struggles at all?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, certainly; I pity him in proportion to his struggles, for they foreshadow the inward suffering which is the worst form of Nemesis. Consequences are unpitying. Our deeds carry their terrible consequences, quite apart from any fluctuations that went before\u2014consequences that are hardly ever confined to ourselves. And it is best to fix our minds on that certainty, instead of considering what may be the elements of excuse for us. But I never knew you so inclined for moral discussion, Arthur? Is it some danger of your own that you are considering in this philosophical, general way?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  In asking this question, Mr. Irwine pushed his plate away, threw himself back in his chair, and looked straight at Arthur. He really suspected that Arthur wanted to tell him something, and thought of smoothing the way for him by this direct question. But he was mistaken. Brought suddenly and involuntarily to the brink of confession, Arthur shrank back and felt less disposed towards it than ever. The conversation had taken a more serious tone than he had intended\u2014it would quite mislead Irwine\u2014he would imagine there was a deep passion for Hetty, while there was no such thing. He was conscious of colouring, and was annoyed at his boyishness. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh no, no danger,\u201d he said as indifferently as he could. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I am more liable to irresolution than other people; only there are little incidents now and then that set one speculating on what might happen in the future.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Was there a motive at work under this strange reluctance of Arthur\u2019s which had a sort of backstairs influence, not admitted to himself? Our mental business is carried on much in the same way as the business of the State: a great deal of hard work is done by agents who are not acknowledged. In a piece of machinery, too, I believe there is often a small unnoticeable wheel which has a great deal to do with the motion of the large obvious ones. Possibly there was some such unrecognized agent secretly busy in Arthur\u2019s mind at this moment\u2014possibly it was the fear lest he might hereafter find the fact of having made a confession to the rector a serious annoyance, in case he should ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"not")," be able quite to carry out his good resolutions? I dare not assert that it was not so. The human soul is a very complex thing. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The idea of Hetty had just crossed Mr. Irwine\u2019s mind as he looked inquiringly at Arthur, but his disclaiming indifferent answer confirmed the thought which had quickly followed\u2014that there could be nothing serious in that direction. There was no probability that Arthur ever saw her except at church, and at her own home under the eye of Mrs. Poyser; and the hint he had given Arthur about her the other day had no more serious meaning than to prevent him from noticing her so as to rouse the little chit\u2019s vanity, and in this way perturb the rustic drama of her life. Arthur would soon join his regiment, and be far away: no, there could be no danger in that quarter, even if Arthur\u2019s character had not been a strong security against it. His honest, patronizing pride in the good-will and respect of everybody about him was a safeguard even against foolish romance, still more against a lower kind of folly. If there had been anything special on Arthur\u2019s mind in the previous conversation, it was clear he was not inclined to enter into details, and Mr. Irwine was too delicate to imply even a friendly curiosity. He perceived a change of subject would be welcome, and said, \u201cBy the way, Arthur, at your colonel\u2019s birthday f\xeate there were some transparencies that made a great effect in honour of Britannia, and Pitt, and the Loamshire Militia, and, above all, the \u2018generous youth,\u2019 the hero of the day. Don\u2019t you think you should get up something of the same sort to astonish our weak minds?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The opportunity was gone. While Arthur was hesitating, the rope to which he might have clung had drifted away\u2014he must trust now to his own swimming. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  In ten minutes from that time, Mr. Irwine was called for on business, and Arthur, bidding him good-bye, mounted his horse again with a sense of dissatisfaction, which he tried to quell by determining to set off for Eagledale without an hour\u2019s delay."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

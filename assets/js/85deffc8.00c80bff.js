A melancholy morning\u2014because it was nearly time hay-harvest should begin, and instead of that the meadows were likely to be flooded. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But people who have pleasant homes get indoor enjoyments that they would never think of but for the rain. If it had not been a wet morning, Mr. Irwine would not have been in the dining-room playing at chess with his mother, and he loves both his mother and chess quite well enough to pass some cloudy hours very easily by their help. Let me take you into that dining-room and show you the Rev. Adolphus Irwine, Rector of Broxton, Vicar of Hayslope, and Vicar of Blythe, a pluralist at whom the severest Church reformer would have found it difficult to look sour. We will enter very softly and stand still in the open doorway, without awaking the glossy-brown setter who is stretched across the hearth, with her two puppies beside her; or the pug, who is dozing, with his black muzzle aloft, like a sleepy president. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The room is a large and lofty one, with an ample mullioned oriel window at one end; the walls, you see, are new, and not yet painted; but the furniture, though originally of an expensive sort, is old and scanty, and there is no drapery about the window. The crimson cloth over the large dining-table is very threadbare, though it contrasts pleasantly enough with the dead hue of the plaster on the walls; but on this cloth there is a massive silver waiter with a decanter of water on it, of the same pattern as two larger ones that are propped up on the sideboard with a coat of arms conspicuous in their centre. You suspect at once that the inhabitants of this room have inherited more blood than wealth, and would not be surprised to find that Mr. Irwine had a finely cut nostril and upper lip; but at present we can only see that he has a broad flat back and an abundance of powdered hair, all thrown backward and tied behind with a black ribbon\u2014a bit of conservatism in costume which tells you that he is not a young man. He will perhaps turn round by and by, and in the meantime we can look at that stately old lady, his mother, a beautiful aged brunette, whose rich-toned complexion is well set off by the complex wrappings of pure white cambric and lace about her head and neck. She is as erect in her comely embonpoint as a statue of Ceres; and her dark face, with its delicate aquiline nose, firm proud mouth, and small, intense, black eye, is so keen and sarcastic in its expression that you instinctively substitute a pack of cards for the chess-men and imagine her telling your fortune. The small brown hand with which she is lifting her queen is laden with pearls, diamonds, and turquoises; and a large black veil is very carefully adjusted over the crown of her cap, and falls in sharp contrast on the white folds about her neck. It must take a long time to dress that old lady in the morning! But it seems a law of nature that she should be dressed so: she is clearly one of those children of royalty who have never doubted their right divine and never met with any one so absurd as to question it. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere, Dauphin, tell me what that is!\u201d says this magnificent old lady, as she deposits her queen very quietly and folds her arms. \u201cI should be sorry to utter a word disagreeable to your feelings.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, you witch-mother, you sorceress!

Splendid old ladies, who take a long time to dress in the morning, have often slight sympathy with sickly daughters. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But while Mr. Irwine was still seated, leaning back in his chair and stroking Juno\u2019s head, the servant came to the door and said, \u201cIf you please, sir, Joshua Rann wishes to speak with you, if you are at liberty.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet him be shown in here,\u201d said Mrs. Irwine, taking up her knitting. \u201cI always like to hear what Mr. Rann has got to say.

Meantime, Mr. Irwine turned round his chair and said, \u201cWell, Joshua, anything the matter at Hayslope, that you\u2019ve come over this damp morning? Sit down, sit down. Never mind the dogs; give them a friendly kick.

Mr. Irwine was one of those men. He bore the same sort of resemblance to his mother that our loving memory of a friend\u2019s face often bears to the face itself: the lines were all more generous, the smile brighter, the expression heartier. If the outline had been less finely cut, his face might have been called jolly; but that was not the right word for its mixture of bonhomie and distinction.

The young gentleman was Arthur Donnithorne, known in Hayslope, variously, as \u201cthe young squire,\u201d \u201cthe heir,\u201d and \u201cthe captain.\u201d He was only a captain in the Loamshire Militia, but to the Hayslope tenants he was more intensely a captain than all the young gentlemen of the same rank in his Majesty\u2019s regulars\u2014he outshone them as the planet Jupiter outshines the Milky Way. If you want to know more particularly how he looked, call to your remembrance some tawny-whiskered, brown-locked, clear-complexioned young Englishman whom you have met with in a foreign town, and been proud of as a fellow-countryman\u2014well-washed, high-bred, white-handed, yet looking as if he could deliver well from \u2018the left shoulder and floor his man: I will not be so much of a tailor as to trouble your imagination with the difference of costume, and insist on the striped waistcoat, long-tailed coat, and low top-boots.

And I believe now he would bear the exaltation as well as any poor wise man in an Eastern story. If ever I live to be a large-acred man instead of a poor devil with a mortgaged allowance of pocket-money, I\u2019ll have Adam for my right hand. He shall manage my woods for me, for he seems to have a better notion of those things than any man I ever met with; and I know he would make twice the money of them that my grandfather does, with that miserable old Satchell to manage, who understands no more about timber than an old carp. I\u2019ve mentioned the subject to my grandfather once or twice, but for some reason or other he has a dislike to Adam, and ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I")," can do nothing. But come, Your Reverence, are you for a ride with me? It\u2019s splendid out of doors now.

You should have come in a little sooner, Arthur, to hear Joshua\u2019s denunciation of his neighbour Will Maskery. The old fellow wants me to excommunicate the wheelwright, and then deliver him over to the civil arm\u2014that is to say, to your grandfather\u2014to be turned out of house and yard. If I chose to interfere in this business, now, I might get up as pretty a story of hatred and persecution as the Methodists need desire to publish in the next number of their magazine. It wouldn\u2019t take me much trouble to persuade Chad Cranage and half a dozen other bull-headed fellows that they would be doing an acceptable service to the Church by hunting Will Maskery out of the village with rope-ends and pitchforks; and then, when I had furnished them with half a sovereign to get gloriously drunk after their exertions, I should have put the climax to as pretty a farce as any of my brother clergy have set going in their parishes for the last thirty years.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt is really insolent of the man, though, to call you an \u2018idle shepherd\u2019 and a \u2018dumb dog,\u2019\u201d said Mrs. Irwine. \u201cI should be inclined to check him a little there.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, pretty well; but Godwin insists on my keeping it up constantly for some time to come. I hope I shall be able to get away to the regiment, though, in the beginning of August.

However, we are to astonish the echoes on the 30th of July. My grandfather has given me ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"carte blanche")," for once, and I promise you the entertainment shall be worthy of the occasion.

She had set her heart on that, sweet soul! Thank God you take after your mother\u2019s family, Arthur. If you had been a puny, wiry, yellow baby, I wouldn\u2019t have stood godmother to you.

I don\u2019t want to know people that look ugly and disagreeable, any more than I want to taste dishes that look disagreeable. If they make me shudder at the first glance, I say, take them away.

It\u2019s a volume of poems, \u2018Lyrical Ballads.\u2019 Most of them seem to be twaddling stuff, but the first is in a different style\u2014\u2018The Ancient Mariner\u2019 is the title. I can hardly make head or tail of it as a story, but it\u2019s a strange, striking thing. I\u2019ll send it over to you; and there are some other books that ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you")," may like to see, Irwine\u2014pamphlets about Antinomianism and Evangelicalism, whatever they may be. I can\u2019t think what the fellow means by sending such things to me.

I\u2019ve a little matter to attend to, Arthur,\u201d continued Mr. Irwine, rising to leave the room, \u201cand then I shall be ready to set out with you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The little matter that Mr. Irwine had to attend to took him up the old stone staircase (part of the house was very old) and made him pause before a door at which he knocked gently. \u201cCome in,\u201d said a woman\u2019s voice, and he entered a room so darkened by blinds and curtains that Miss Kate, the thin middle-aged lady standing by the bedside, would not have had light enough for any other sort of work than the knitting which lay on the little table near her. But at present she was doing what required only the dimmest light\u2014sponging the aching head that lay on the pillow with fresh vinegar. It was a small face, that of the poor sufferer; perhaps it had once been pretty, but now it was worn and sallow. Miss Kate came towards her brother and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t speak to her; she can\u2019t bear to be spoken to to-day.\u201d Anne\u2019s eyes were closed, and her brow contracted as if from intense pain. Mr. Irwine went to the bedside and took up one of the delicate hands and kissed it, a slight pressure from the small fingers told him that it was worth-while to have come upstairs for the sake of doing that. He lingered a moment, looking at her, and then turned away and left the room, treading very gently\u2014he had taken off his boots and put on slippers before he came upstairs. Whoever remembers how many things he has declined to do even for himself, rather than have the trouble of putting on or taking off his boots, will not think this last detail insignificant. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  And Mr. Irwine\u2019s sisters, as any person of family within ten miles of Broxton could have testified, were such stupid, uninteresting women! It was quite a pity handsome, clever Mrs. Irwine should have had such commonplace daughters. That fine old lady herself was worth driving ten miles to see, any day; her beauty, her well-preserved faculties, and her old-fashioned dignity made her a graceful subject for conversation in turn with the King\u2019s health, the sweet new patterns in cotton dresses, the news from Egypt, and Lord Dacey\u2019s lawsuit, which was fretting poor Lady Dacey to death. But no one ever thought of mentioning the Miss Irwines, except the poor people in Broxton village, who regarded them as deep in the science of medicine, and spoke of them vaguely as \u201cthe gentlefolks.\u201d If any one had asked old Job Dummilow who gave him his flannel jacket, he would have answered, \u201cthe gentlefolks, last winter\u201d; and widow Steene dwelt much on the virtues of the \u201cstuff\u201d the gentlefolks gave her for her cough. Under this name too, they were used with great effect as a means of taming refractory children, so that at the sight of poor Miss Anne\u2019s sallow face, several small urchins had a terrified sense that she was cognizant of all their worst misdemeanours, and knew the precise number of stones with which they had intended to hit Farmer Britton\u2019s ducks. But for all who saw them through a less mythical medium, the Miss Irwines were quite superfluous existences\u2014inartistic figures crowding the canvas of life without adequate effect. Miss Anne, indeed, if her chronic headaches could have been accounted for by a pathetic story of disappointed love, might have had some romantic interest attached to her: but no such story had either been known or invented concerning her, and the general impression was quite in accordance with the fact, that both the sisters were old maids for the prosaic reason that they had never received an eligible offer. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Nevertheless, to speak paradoxically, the existence of insignificant people has very important consequences in the world. It can be shown to affect the price of bread and the rate of wages, to call forth many evil tempers from the selfish and many heroisms from the sympathetic, and, in other ways, to play no small part in the tragedy of life. And if that handsome, generous-blooded clergyman, the Rev. Adolphus Irwine, had not had these two hopelessly maiden sisters, his lot would have been shaped quite differently: he would very likely have taken a comely wife in his youth, and now, when his hair was getting grey under the powder, would have had tall sons and blooming daughters\u2014such possessions, in short, as men commonly think will repay them for all the labour they take under the sun. As it was\u2014having with all his three livings no more than seven hundred a-year, and seeing no way of keeping his splendid mother and his sickly sister, not to reckon a second sister, who was usually spoken of without any adjective, in such ladylike ease as became their birth and habits, and at the same time providing for a family of his own\u2014he remained, you see, at the age of eight-and-forty, a bachelor, not making any merit of that renunciation, but saying laughingly, if any one alluded to it, that he made it an excuse for many indulgences which a wife would never have allowed him. And perhaps he was the only person in the world who did not think his sisters uninteresting and superfluous; for his was one of those large-hearted, sweet-blooded natures that never know a narrow or a grudging thought; Epicurean, if you will, with no enthusiasm, no self-scourging sense of duty; but yet, as you have seen, of a sufficiently subtle moral fibre to have an unwearying tenderness for obscure and monotonous suffering. It was his large-hearted indulgence that made him ignore his mother\u2019s hardness towards her daughters, which was the more striking from its contrast with her doting fondness towards himself; he held it no virtue to frown at irremediable faults. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  See the difference between the impression a man makes on you when you walk by his side in familiar talk, or look at him in his home, and the figure he makes when seen from a lofty historical level, or even in the eyes of a critical neighbour who thinks of him as an embodied system or opinion rather than as a man. Mr. Roe, the \u201ctravelling preacher\u201d stationed at Treddleston, had included Mr. Irwine in a general statement concerning the Church clergy in the surrounding district, whom he described as men given up to the lusts of the flesh and the pride of life; hunting and shooting, and adorning their own houses; asking what shall we eat, and what shall we drink, and wherewithal shall we be clothed?\u2014careless of dispensing the bread of life to their flocks, preaching at best but a carnal and soul-benumbing morality, and trafficking in the souls of men by receiving money for discharging the pastoral office in parishes where they did not so much as look on the faces of the people more than once a-year. The ecclesiastical historian, too, looking into parliamentary reports of that period, finds honourable members zealous for the Church, and untainted with any sympathy for the \u201ctribe of canting Methodists,\u201d making statements scarcely less melancholy than that of Mr. Roe. And it is impossible for me to say that Mr. Irwine was altogether belied by the generic classification assigned him. He really had no very lofty aims, no theological enthusiasm: if I were closely questioned, I should be obliged to confess that he felt no serious alarms about the souls of his parishioners, and would have thought it a mere loss of time to talk in a doctrinal and awakening manner to old \u201cFeyther Taft,\u201d or even to Chad Cranage the blacksmith. If he had been in the habit of speaking theoretically, he would perhaps have said that the only healthy form religion could take in such minds was that of certain dim but strong emotions, suffusing themselves as a hallowing influence over the family affections and neighbourly duties. He thought the custom of baptism more important than its doctrine, and that the religious benefits the peasant drew from the church where his fathers worshipped and the sacred piece of turf where they lay buried were but slightly dependent on a clear understanding of the Liturgy or the sermon. Clearly the rector was not what is called in these days an \u201cearnest\u201d man: he was fonder of church history than of divinity, and had much more insight into men\u2019s characters than interest in their opinions; he was neither laborious, nor obviously self-denying, nor very copious in alms-giving, and his theology, you perceive, was lax. His mental palate, indeed, was rather pagan, and found a savouriness in a quotation from Sophocles or Theocritus that was quite absent from any text in Isaiah or Amos. But if you feed your young setter on raw flesh, how can you wonder at its retaining a relish for uncooked partridge in after-life? And Mr. Irwine\u2019s recollections of young enthusiasm and ambition were all associated with poetry and ethics that lay aloof from the Bible. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  On the other hand, I must plead, for I have an affectionate partiality towards the rector\u2019s memory, that he was not vindictive\u2014and some philanthropists have been so; that he was not intolerant\u2014and there is a rumour that some zealous theologians have not been altogether free from that blemish; that although he would probably have declined to give his body to be burned in any public cause, and was far from bestowing all his goods to feed the poor, he had that charity which has sometimes been lacking to very illustrious virtue\u2014he was tender to other men\u2019s failings, and unwilling to impute evil. He was one of those men, and they are not the commonest, of whom we can know the best only by following them away from the marketplace, the platform, and the pulpit, entering with them into their own homes, hearing the voice with which they speak to the young and aged about their own hearthstone, and witnessing their thoughtful care for the everyday wants of everyday companions, who take all their kindness as a matter of course, and not as a subject for panegyric. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Such men, happily, have lived in times when great abuses flourished, and have sometimes even been the living representatives of the abuses.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But whatever you may think of Mr. Irwine now, if you had met him that June afternoon riding on his grey cob, with his dogs running beside him\u2014portly, upright, manly, with a good-natured smile on his finely turned lips as he talked to his dashing young companion on the bay mare, you must have felt that, however ill he harmonized with sound theories of the clerical office, he somehow harmonized extremely well with that peaceful landscape.

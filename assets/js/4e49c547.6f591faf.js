He was master there now; he had half fulfilled his father\u2019s dying wish, and by years of steady self-government and energetic work he had brought himself near to the attainment of more than the old respectability which had been the proud inheritance of the Dodsons and Tullivers. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But Tom\u2019s face, as he stood in the hot, still sunshine of that summer afternoon, had no gladness, no triumph in it. His mouth wore its bitterest expression, his severe brow its hardest and deepest fold, as he drew down his hat farther over his eyes to shelter them from the sun, and thrusting his hands deep into his pockets, began to walk up and down the gravel. No news of his sister had been heard since Bob Jakin had come back in the steamer from Mudport, and put an end to all improbable suppositions of an accident on the water by stating that he had seen her land from a vessel with Mr Stephen Guest. Would the next news be that she was married,\u2014or what? Probably that she was not married; Tom\u2019s mind was set to the expectation of the worst that could happen,\u2014not death, but disgrace. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  As he was walking with his back toward the entrance gate, and his face toward the rushing mill-stream, a tall, dark-eyed figure, that we know well, approached the gate, and paused to look at him with a fast-beating heart. Her brother was the human being of whom she had been most afraid from her childhood upward; afraid with that fear which springs in us when we love one who is inexorable, unbending, unmodifiable, with a mind that we can never mould ourselves upon, and yet that we cannot endure to alienate from us. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  That deep-rooted fear was shaking Maggie now; but her mind was unswervingly bent on returning to her brother, as the natural refuge that had been given her. In her deep humiliation under the retrospect of her own weakness,\u2014in her anguish at the injury she had inflicted,\u2014she almost desired to endure the severity of Tom\u2019s reproof, to submit in patient silence to that harsh, disapproving judgment against which she had so often rebelled; it seemed no more than just to her now,\u2014who was weaker than she was? She craved that outward help to her better purpose which would come from complete, submissive confession; from being in the presence of those whose looks and words would be a reflection of her own conscience. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie had been kept on her bed at York for a day with that prostrating headache which was likely to follow on the terrible strain of the previous day and night. There was an expression of physical pain still about her brow and eyes, and her whole appearance, with her dress so long unchanged, was worn and distressed. She lifted the latch of the gate and walked in slowly. Tom did not hear the gate; he was just then close upon the roaring dam; but he presently turned, and lifting up his eyes, saw the figure whose worn look and loneliness seemed to him a confirmation of his worst conjectures. He paused, trembling and white with disgust and indignation. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie paused too, three yards before him. She felt the hatred in his face, felt it rushing through her fibres; but she must speak. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTom,\u201d she began faintly, \u201cI am come back to you,\u2014I am come back home\u2014for refuge\u2014to tell you everything.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou will find no home with me,\u201d he answered, with tremulous rage. \u201cYou have disgraced us all. You have disgraced my father\u2019s name. You have been a curse to your best friends. You have been base, deceitful; no motives are strong enough to restrain you. I wash my hands of you forever. You don\u2019t belong to me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Their mother had come to the door now. She stood paralyzed by the double shock of seeing Maggie and hearing Tom\u2019s words. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTom,\u201d said Maggie, with more courage, \u201cI am perhaps not so guilty as you believe me to be. I never meant to give way to my feelings. I struggled against them. I was carried too far in the boat to come back on Tuesday. I came back as soon as I could.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI can\u2019t believe in you any more,\u201d said Tom, gradually passing from the tremulous excitement of the first moment to cold inflexibility. \u201cYou have been carrying on a clandestine relation with Stephen Guest,\u2014as you did before with another. He went to see you at my aunt Moss\u2019s; you walked alone with him in the lanes; you must have behaved as no modest girl would have done to her cousin\u2019s lover, else that could never have happened. The people at Luckreth saw you pass; you passed all the other places; you knew what you were doing. You have been using Philip Wakem as a screen to deceive Lucy,\u2014the kindest friend you ever had. Go and see the return you have made her. She\u2019s ill; unable to speak. My mother can\u2019t go near her, lest she should remind her of you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie was half stunned,\u2014too heavily pressed upon by her anguish even to discern any difference between her actual guilt and her brother\u2019s accusations, still less to vindicate herself. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTom,\u201d she said, crushing her hands together under her cloak, in the effort to speak again, \u201cwhatever I have done, I repent it bitterly. I want to make amends.

If you are in want, I will provide for you; let my mother know. But you shall not come under my roof. It is enough that I have to bear the thought of your disgrace; the sight of you is hateful to me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Slowly Maggie was turning away with despair in her heart. But the poor frightened mother\u2019s love leaped out now, stronger than all dread. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMy child! I\u2019ll go with you. You\u2019ve got a mother.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Oh, the sweet rest of that embrace to the heart-stricken Maggie!

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCome in, my child,\u201d Mrs Tulliver whispered. \u201cHe\u2019ll let you stay and sleep in my bed. He won\u2019t deny that if I ask him.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, mother,\u201d said Maggie, in a low tone, like a moan. \u201cI will never go in.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThen wait for me outside. I\u2019ll get ready and come with you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  When his mother appeared with her bonnet on, Tom came out to her in the passage, and put money into her hands. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMy house is yours, mother, always,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will come and let me know everything you want; you will come back to me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Poor Mrs Tulliver took the money, too frightened to say anything. The only thing clear to her was the mother\u2019s instinct that she would go with her unhappy child. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie was waiting outside the gate; she took her mother\u2019s hand and they walked a little way in silence. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMother,\u201d said Maggie, at last, \u201cwe will go to Luke\u2019s cottage. Luke will take me in. He was very good to me when I was a little girl.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHe\u2019s got no room for us, my dear, now; his wife\u2019s got so many children. I don\u2019t know where to go, if it isn\u2019t to one o\u2019 your aunts; and I hardly durst,\u201d said poor Mrs Tulliver, quite destitute of mental resources in this extremity. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie was silent a little while, and then said,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet us go to Bob Jakin\u2019s, mother; his wife will have room for us, if they have no other lodger.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  So they went on their way to St Ogg\u2019s, to the old house by the river-side. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Bob himself was at home, with a heaviness at heart which resisted even the new joy and pride of possessing a two-months\u2019-old baby, quite the liveliest of its age that had ever been born to prince or packman. He would perhaps not so thoroughly have understood all the dubiousness of Maggie\u2019s appearance with Mr Stephen Guest on the quay at Mudport if he had not witnessed the effect it produced on Tom when he went to report it; and since then, the circumstances which in any case gave a disastrous character to her elopement had passed beyond the more polite circles of St Ogg\u2019s, and had become matter of common talk, accessible to the grooms and errand-boys. So that when he opened the door and saw Maggie standing before him in her sorrow and weariness, he had no questions to ask except one which he dared only ask himself,\u2014where was Mr Stephen Guest? Bob, for his part, hoped he might be in the warmest department of an asylum understood to exist in the other world for gentlemen who are likely to be in fallen circumstances there. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The lodgings were vacant, and both Mrs Jakin the larger and Mrs Jakin the less were commanded to make all things comfortable for \u201cthe old Missis and the young Miss\u201d; alas that she was still \u201cMiss!\u201d The ingenious Bob was sorely perplexed as to how this result could have come about; how Mr Stephen Guest could have gone away from her, or could have let her go away from him, when he had the chance of keeping her with him. But he was silent, and would not allow his wife to ask him a question; would not present himself in the room, lest it should appear like intrusion and a wish to pry; having the same chivalry toward dark-eyed Maggie as in the days when he had bought her the memorable present of books. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But after a day or two Mrs Tulliver was gone to the Mill again for a few hours to see to Tom\u2019s household matters. Maggie had wished this; after the first violent outburst of feeling which came as soon as she had no longer any active purpose to fulfil, she was less in need of her mother\u2019s presence; she even desired to be alone with her grief. But she had been solitary only a little while in the old sitting-room that looked on the river, when there came a tap at the door, and turning round her sad face as she said \u201cCome in,\u201d she saw Bob enter, with the baby in his arms and Mumps at his heels. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWe\u2019ll go back, if it disturbs you, Miss,\u201d said Bob. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo,\u201d said Maggie, in a low voice, wishing she could smile. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Bob, closing the door behind him, came and stood before her. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou see, we\u2019ve got a little un, Miss, and I want\u2019d you to look at it, and take it in your arms, if you\u2019d be so good.

Maggie\u2019s heart had swelled at this action and speech of Bob\u2019s; she knew well enough that it was a way he had chosen to show his sympathy and respect. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSit down, Bob,\u201d she said presently, and he sat down in silence, finding his tongue unmanageable in quite a new fashion, refusing to say what he wanted it to say. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBob,\u201d she said, after a few moments, looking down at the baby, and holding it anxiously, as if she feared it might slip from her mind and her fingers, \u201cI have a favour to ask of you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t you speak so, Miss,\u201d said Bob, grasping the skin of Mumps\u2019s neck; \u201cif there\u2019s anything I can do for you, I should look upon it as a day\u2019s earnings.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI want you to go to Dr Kenn\u2019s, and ask to speak to him, and tell him that I am here, and should be very grateful if he would come to me while my mother is away.

But the subjects on which he longed to be informed were so steep and difficult of approach, that his tongue was likely to run on along the level rather than to carry him on that unbeaten road. He felt this, and was silent again for a little while, ruminating much on the possible forms in which he might put a question. At last he said, in a more timid voice than usual,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWill you give me leave to ask you only one thing, Miss?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie was rather startled, but she answered, \u201cYes, Bob, if it is about myself\u2014not about any one else.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, Miss, it\u2019s this.

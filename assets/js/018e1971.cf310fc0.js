He consoled himself after a time with reflecting that, since Adam\u2019s trouble, Lisbeth had been very timid about speaking to him on matters of feeling, and that she would hardly dare to approach this tenderest of all subjects. Even if she did, he hoped Adam would not take much notice of what she said. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Seth was right in believing that Lisbeth would be held in restraint by timidity, and during the next three days, the intervals in which she had an opportunity of speaking to Adam were too rare and short to cause her any strong temptation. But in her long solitary hours she brooded over her regretful thoughts about Dinah, till they had grown very near that point of unmanageable strength when thoughts are apt to take wing out of their secret nest in a startling manner. And on Sunday morning, when Seth went away to chapel at Treddleston, the dangerous opportunity came. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Sunday morning was the happiest time in all the week to Lisbeth, for as there was no service at Hayslope church till the afternoon, Adam was always at home, doing nothing but reading, an occupation in which she could venture to interrupt him. Moreover, she had always a better dinner than usual to prepare for her sons\u2014very frequently for Adam and herself alone, Seth being often away the entire day\u2014and the smell of the roast meat before the clear fire in the clean kitchen, the clock ticking in a peaceful Sunday manner, her darling Adam seated near her in his best clothes, doing nothing very important, so that she could go and stroke her hand across his hair if she liked, and see him look up at her and smile, while Gyp, rather jealous, poked his muzzle up between them\u2014all these things made poor Lisbeth\u2019s earthly paradise. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  The book Adam most often read on a Sunday morning was his large pictured Bible, and this morning it lay open before him on the round white deal table in the kitchen; for he sat there in spite of the fire, because he knew his mother liked to have him with her, and it was the only day in the week when he could indulge her in that way. You would have liked to see Adam reading his Bible. He never opened it on a weekday, and so he came to it as a holiday book, serving him for history, biography, and poetry. He held one hand thrust between his waistcoat buttons, and the other ready to turn the pages, and in the course of the morning you would have seen many changes in his face. Sometimes his lips moved in semi-articulation\u2014it was when he came to a speech that he could fancy himself uttering, such as Samuel\u2019s dying speech to the people; then his eyebrows would be raised, and the corners of his mouth would quiver a little with sad sympathy\u2014something, perhaps old Isaac\u2019s meeting with his son, touched him closely; at other times, over the New Testament, a very solemn look would come upon his face, and he would every now and then shake his head in serious assent, or just lift up his hand and let it fall again. And on some mornings, when he read in the Apocrypha, of which he was very fond, the son of Sirach\u2019s keen-edged words would bring a delighted smile, though he also enjoyed the freedom of occasionally differing from an Apocryphal writer. For Adam knew the Articles quite well, as became a good churchman. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Lisbeth, in the pauses of attending to her dinner, always sat opposite to him and watched him, till she could rest no longer without going up to him and giving him a caress, to call his attention to her. This morning he was reading the Gospel according to St. Matthew, and Lisbeth had been standing close by him for some minutes, stroking his hair, which was smoother than usual this morning, and looking down at the large page with silent wonderment at the mystery of letters. She was encouraged to continue this caress, because when she first went up to him, he had thrown himself back in his chair to look at her affectionately and say, \u201cWhy, Mother, thee look\u2019st rare and hearty this morning. Eh, Gyp wants me t\u2019 look at him. He can\u2019t abide to think I love thee the best.\u201d Lisbeth said nothing, because she wanted to say so many things. And now there was a new leaf to be turned over, and it was a picture\u2014that of the angel seated on the great stone that has been rolled away from the sepulchre. This picture had one strong association in Lisbeth\u2019s memory, for she had been reminded of it when she first saw Dinah, and Adam had no sooner turned the page, and lifted the book sideways that they might look at the angel, than she said, \u201cThat\u2019s her\u2014that\u2019s Dinah.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Adam smiled, and, looking more intently at the angel\u2019s face, said, "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt ",(0,h.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"is")," a bit like her; but Dinah\u2019s prettier, I think.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, then, if thee think\u2019st her so pretty, why arn\u2019t fond on her?\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Adam looked up in surprise. \u201cWhy, Mother, dost think I don\u2019t set store by Dinah?\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay,\u201d said Lisbeth, frightened at her own courage, yet feeling that she had broken the ice, and the waters must flow, whatever mischief they might do. \u201cWhat\u2019s th\u2019 use o\u2019 settin\u2019 store by things as are thirty mile off?

That was the utmost severity he could show towards his mother on a Sunday morning. But Lisbeth had gone too far now to check herself, and after scarcely a minute\u2019s quietness she began again. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThee mightst know well enough who \u2019tis I\u2019d like t\u2019 ha\u2019 wi\u2019 me. It isna many folks I send for t\u2019 come an\u2019 see me. I reckon.

If Dinah \u2019ud be willing to stay at Hayslope, it isn\u2019t likely she can come away from her aunt\u2019s house, where they hold her like a daughter, and where she\u2019s more bound than she is to us. If it had been so that she could ha\u2019 married Seth, that \u2019ud ha\u2019 been a great blessing to us, but we can\u2019t have things just as we like in this life. Thee must try and make up thy mind to do without her.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, but I canna ma\u2019 up my mind, when she\u2019s just cut out for thee; an\u2019 nought shall ma\u2019 me believe as God didna make her an\u2019 send her there o\u2019 purpose for thee. What\u2019s it sinnify about her bein\u2019 a Methody! It \u2019ud happen wear out on her wi\u2019 marryin\u2019.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Adam threw himself back in his chair and looked at his mother. He understood now what she had been aiming at from the beginning of the conversation. It was as unreasonable, impracticable a wish as she had ever urged, but he could not help being moved by so entirely new an idea. The chief point, however, was to chase away the notion from his mother\u2019s mind as quickly as possible. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMother,\u201d he said, gravely, \u201cthee\u2019t talking wild. Don\u2019t let me hear thee say such things again. It\u2019s no good talking o\u2019 what can never be. Dinah\u2019s not for marrying; she\u2019s fixed her heart on a different sort o\u2019 life.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cVery like,\u201d said Lisbeth, impatiently, \u201cvery like she\u2019s none for marr\u2019ing, when them as she\u2019d be willin\u2019 t\u2019 marry wonna ax her. I shouldna ha\u2019 been for marr\u2019ing thy feyther if he\u2019d ne\u2019er axed me; an\u2019 she\u2019s as fond o\u2019 thee as e\u2019er I war o\u2019 Thias, poor fellow.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  The blood rushed to Adam\u2019s face, and for a few moments he was not quite conscious where he was. His mother and the kitchen had vanished for him, and he saw nothing but Dinah\u2019s face turned up towards his. It seemed as if there were a resurrection of his dead joy. But he woke up very speedily from that dream (the waking was chill and sad), for it would have been very foolish in him to believe his mother\u2019s words\u2014she could have no ground for them. He was prompted to express his disbelief very strongly\u2014perhaps that he might call forth the proofs, if there were any to be offered. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat dost say such things for, Mother, when thee\u2019st got no foundation for \u2019em? Thee know\u2019st nothing as gives thee a right to say that.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThen I knowna nought as gi\u2019es me a right to say as the year\u2019s turned, for all I feel it fust thing when I get up i\u2019 th\u2019 morning. She isna fond o\u2019 Seth, I reckon, is she? She doesna want to marry ",(0,h.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"him?")," But I can see as she doesna behave tow\u2019rt thee as she daes tow\u2019rt Seth. She makes no more o\u2019 Seth\u2019s coming a-nigh her nor if he war Gyp, but she\u2019s all of a tremble when thee\u2019t a-sittin\u2019 down by her at breakfast an\u2019 a-looking at her. Thee think\u2019st thy mother knows nought, but she war alive afore thee wast born.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut thee canstna be sure as the trembling means love?\u201d said Adam anxiously. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cEh, what else should it mane? It isna hate, I reckon. An\u2019 what should she do but love thee? Thee\u2019t made to be loved\u2014for where\u2019s there a straighter cliverer man? An\u2019 what\u2019s it sinnify her bein\u2019 a Methody? It\u2019s on\u2019y the marigold i\u2019 th\u2019 parridge.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Adam had thrust his hands in his pockets, and was looking down at the book on the table, without seeing any of the letters. He was trembling like a gold-seeker who sees the strong promise of gold but sees in the same moment a sickening vision of disappointment. He could not trust his mother\u2019s insight; she had seen what she wished to see. And yet\u2014and yet, now the suggestion had been made to him, he remembered so many things, very slight things, like the stirring of the water by an imperceptible breeze, which seemed to him some confirmation of his mother\u2019s words. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Lisbeth noticed that he was moved. She went on, \u201cAn\u2019 thee\u2019t find out as thee\u2019t poorly aff when she\u2019s gone. Thee\u2019t fonder on her nor thee know\u2019st. Thy eyes follow her about, welly as Gyp\u2019s follow thee.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Adam could sit still no longer. He rose, took down his hat, and went out into the fields. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  The sunshine was on them: that early autumn sunshine which we should know was not summer\u2019s, even if there were not the touches of yellow on the lime and chestnut; the Sunday sunshine too, which has more than autumnal calmness for the working man; the morning sunshine, which still leaves the dew-crystals on the fine gossamer webs in the shadow of the bushy hedgerows. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Adam needed the calm influence; he was amazed at the way in which this new thought of Dinah\u2019s love had taken possession of him, with an overmastering power that made all other feelings give way before the impetuous desire to know that the thought was true. Strange, that till that moment the possibility of their ever being lovers had never crossed his mind, and yet now, all his longing suddenly went out towards that possibility. He had no more doubt or hesitation as to his own wishes than the bird that flies towards the opening through which the daylight gleams and the breath of heaven enters. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  The autumnal Sunday sunshine soothed him, but not by preparing him with resignation to the disappointment if his mother\u2014if he himself\u2014proved to be mistaken about Dinah. It soothed him by gentle encouragement of his hopes. Her love was so like that calm sunshine that they seemed to make one presence to him, and he believed in them both alike. And Dinah was so bound up with the sad memories of his first passion that he was not forsaking them, but rather giving them a new sacredness by loving her. Nay, his love for her had grown out of that past: it was the noon of that morning. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  But Seth? Would the lad be hurt? Hardly; for he had seemed quite contented of late, and there was no selfish jealousy in him; he had never been jealous of his mother\u2019s fondness for Adam. But had ",(0,h.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"he")," seen anything of what their mother talked about? Adam longed to know this, for he thought he could trust Seth\u2019s observation better than his mother\u2019s. He must talk to Seth before he went to see Dinah, and, with this intention in his mind, he walked back to the cottage and said to his mother, \u201cDid Seth say anything to thee about when he was coming home? Will he be back to dinner?\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAye, lad, he\u2019ll be back for a wonder. He isna gone to Treddles\u2019on. He\u2019s gone somewhere else a-preachin\u2019 and a-prayin\u2019.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHast any notion which way he\u2019s gone?\u201d said Adam. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, but he aften goes to th\u2019 Common. Thee know\u2019st more o\u2019s goings nor I do.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Adam wanted to go and meet Seth, but he must content himself with walking about the near fields and getting sight of him as soon as possible. That would not be for more than an hour to come, for Seth would scarcely be at home much before their dinner-time, which was twelve o\u2019clock. But Adam could not sit down to his reading again, and he sauntered along by the brook and stood leaning against the stiles, with eager intense eyes, which looked as if they saw something very vividly; but it was not the brook or the willows, not the fields or the sky. Again and again his vision was interrupted by wonder at the strength of his own feeling, at the strength and sweetness of this new love\u2014almost like the wonder a man feels at the added power he finds in himself for an art which he had laid aside for a space. How is it that the poets have said so many fine things about our first love, so few about our later love? Are their first poems their best? Or are not those the best which come from their fuller thought, their larger experience, their deeper-rooted affections? The boy\u2019s flutelike voice has its own spring charm; but the man should yield a richer deeper music. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  At last, there was Seth, visible at the farthest stile, and Adam hastened to meet him. Seth was surprised, and thought something unusual must have happened, but when Adam came up, his face said plainly enough that it was nothing alarming. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhere hast been?\u201d said Adam, when they were side by side. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ve been to the Common,\u201d said Seth. \u201cDinah\u2019s been speaking the Word to a little company of hearers at Brimstone\u2019s, as they call him. They\u2019re folks as never go to church hardly\u2014them on the Common\u2014but they\u2019ll go and hear Dinah a bit. She\u2019s been speaking with power this forenoon from the words, \u2018I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\u2019 And there was a little thing happened as was pretty to see. The women mostly bring their children with \u2019em, but to-day there was one stout curly headed fellow about three or four year old, that I never saw there before. He was as naughty as could be at the beginning while I was praying, and while we was singing, but when we all sat down and Dinah began to speak, th\u2019 young un stood stock still all at once, and began to look at her with\u2019s mouth open, and presently he ran away from\u2019s mother and went to Dinah, and pulled at her, like a little dog, for her to take notice of him. So Dinah lifted him up and held th\u2019 lad on her lap, while she went on speaking; and he was as good as could be till he went to sleep\u2014and the mother cried to see him.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s a pity she shouldna be a mother herself,\u201d said Adam, \u201cso fond as the children are of her. Dost think she\u2019s quite fixed against marrying, Seth? Dost think nothing \u2019ud turn her?\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  There was something peculiar in his brother\u2019s tone, which made Seth steal a glance at his face before he answered. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt \u2019ud be wrong of me to say nothing \u2019ud turn her,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut if thee mean\u2019st it about myself, I\u2019ve given up all thoughts as she can ever be ",(0,h.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"my")," wife. She calls me her brother, and that\u2019s enough.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut dost think she might ever get fond enough of anybody else to be willing to marry \u2019em?\u201d said Adam rather shyly. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d said Seth, after some hesitation, \u201cit\u2019s crossed my mind sometimes o\u2019 late as she might; but Dinah \u2019ud let no fondness for the creature draw her out o\u2019 the path as she believed God had marked out for her. If she thought the leading was not from Him, she\u2019s not one to be brought under the power of it. And she\u2019s allays seemed clear about that\u2014as her work was to minister t\u2019 others, and make no home for herself i\u2019 this world.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut suppose,\u201d said Adam, earnestly, \u201csuppose there was a man as \u2019ud let her do just the same and not interfere with her\u2014she might do a good deal o\u2019 what she does now, just as well when she was married as when she was single. Other women of her sort have married\u2014that\u2019s to say, not just like her, but women as preached and attended on the sick and needy. There\u2019s Mrs. Fletcher as she talks of.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  A new light had broken in on Seth. He turned round, and laying his hand on Adam\u2019s shoulder, said, \u201cWhy, wouldst like her to marry ",(0,h.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"thee"),", brother?\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Adam looked doubtfully at Seth\u2019s inquiring eyes and said, \u201cWouldst be hurt if she was to be fonder o\u2019 me than o\u2019 thee?\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay,\u201d said Seth warmly, \u201chow canst think it? Have I felt thy trouble so little that I shouldna feel thy joy?\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  There was silence a few moments as they walked on, and then Seth said, \u201cI\u2019d no notion as thee\u2019dst ever think of her for a wife.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut is it o\u2019 any use to think of her?\u201d said Adam. \u201cWhat dost say? Mother\u2019s made me as I hardly know where I am, with what she\u2019s been saying to me this forenoon. She says she\u2019s sure Dinah feels for me more than common, and \u2019ud be willing t\u2019 have me. But I\u2019m afraid she speaks without book. I want to know if thee\u2019st seen anything.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s a nice point to speak about,\u201d said Seth, \u201cand I\u2019m afraid o\u2019 being wrong; besides, we\u2019ve no right t\u2019 intermeddle with people\u2019s feelings when they wouldn\u2019t tell \u2019em themselves.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Seth paused. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut thee mightst ask her,\u201d he said presently. \u201cShe took no offence at ",(0,h.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"me")," for asking, and thee\u2019st more right than I had, only thee\u2019t not in the Society. But Dinah doesn\u2019t hold wi\u2019 them as are for keeping the Society so strict to themselves. She doesn\u2019t mind about making folks enter the Society, so as they\u2019re fit t\u2019 enter the kingdom o\u2019 God.

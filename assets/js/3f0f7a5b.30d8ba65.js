Dinah had taken off her little Quaker bonnet again, and was holding it in her hands that she might have a freer enjoyment of the cool evening twilight, and Seth could see the expression of her face quite clearly as he walked by her side, timidly revolving something he wanted to say to her. It was an expression of unconscious placid gravity\u2014of absorption in thoughts that had no connection with the present moment or with her own personality\u2014an expression that is most of all discouraging to a lover. Her very walk was discouraging: it had that quiet elasticity that asks for no support. Seth felt this dimly; he said to himself, \u201cShe\u2019s too good and holy for any man, let alone me,\u201d and the words he had been summoning rushed back again before they had reached his lips. But another thought gave him courage: \u201cThere\u2019s no man could love her better and leave her freer to follow the Lord\u2019s work.\u201d They had been silent for many minutes now, since they had done talking about Bessy Cranage; Dinah seemed almost to have forgotten Seth\u2019s presence, and her pace was becoming so much quicker that the sense of their being only a few minutes\u2019 walk from the yard-gates of the Hall Farm at last gave Seth courage to speak. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019ve quite made up your mind to go back to Snowfield o\u2019 Saturday, Dinah?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Dinah, quietly. \u201cI\u2019m called there. It was borne in upon my mind while I was meditating on Sunday night, as Sister Allen, who\u2019s in a decline, is in need of me. I saw her as plain as we see that bit of thin white cloud, lifting up her poor thin hand and beckoning to me. And this morning when I opened the Bible for direction, the first words my eyes fell on were, \u2018And after we had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia.\u2019 If it wasn\u2019t for that clear showing of the Lord\u2019s will, I should be loath to go, for my heart yearns over my aunt and her little ones, and that poor wandering lamb Hetty Sorrel. I\u2019ve been much drawn out in prayer for her of late, and I look on it as a token that there may be mercy in store for her.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGod grant it,\u201d said Seth. \u201cFor I doubt Adam\u2019s heart is so set on her, he\u2019ll never turn to anybody else; and yet it \u2019ud go to my heart if he was to marry her, for I canna think as she\u2019d make him happy. It\u2019s a deep mystery\u2014the way the heart of man turns to one woman out of all the rest he\u2019s seen i\u2019 the world, and makes it easier for him to work seven year for ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her"),", like Jacob did for Rachel, sooner than have any other woman for th\u2019 asking. I often think of them words, \u2018And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days for the love he had to her.\u2019 I know those words \u2019ud come true with me, Dinah, if so be you\u2019d give me hope as I might win you after seven years was over. I know you think a husband \u2019ud be taking up too much o\u2019 your thoughts, because St. Paul says, \u2018She that\u2019s married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband\u2019; and may happen you\u2019ll think me overbold to speak to you about it again, after what you told me o\u2019 your mind last Saturday. But I\u2019ve been thinking it over again by night and by day, and I\u2019ve prayed not to be blinded by my own desires, to think what\u2019s only good for me must be good for you too. And it seems to me there\u2019s more texts for your marrying than ever you can find against it. For St. Paul says as plain as can be in another place, \u2018I will that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully\u2019; and then \u2018two are better than one\u2019; and that holds good with marriage as well as with other things. For we should be o\u2019 one heart and o\u2019 one mind, Dinah. We both serve the same Master, and are striving after the same gifts; and I\u2019d never be the husband to make a claim on you as could interfere with your doing the work God has fitted you for. I\u2019d make a shift, and fend indoor and out, to give you more liberty\u2014more than you can have now, for you\u2019ve got to get your own living now, and I\u2019m strong enough to work for us both.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  When Seth had once begun to urge his suit, he went on earnestly and almost hurriedly, lest Dinah should speak some decisive word before he had poured forth all the arguments he had prepared. His cheeks became flushed as he went on, his mild grey eyes filled with tears, and his voice trembled as he spoke the last sentence. They had reached one of those very narrow passes between two tall stones, which performed the office of a stile in Loamshire, and Dinah paused as she turned towards Seth and said, in her tender but calm treble notes, \u201cSeth Bede, I thank you for your love towards me, and if I could think of any man as more than a Christian brother, I think it would be you. But my heart is not free to marry. That is good for other women, and it is a great and a blessed thing to be a wife and mother; but \u2018as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every man, so let him walk.\u2019 God has called me to minister to others, not to have any joys or sorrows of my own, but to rejoice with them that do rejoice, and to weep with those that weep. He has called me to speak his word, and he has greatly owned my work. It could only be on a very clear showing that I could leave the brethren and sisters at Snowfield, who are favoured with very little of this world\u2019s good; where the trees are few, so that a child might count them, and there\u2019s very hard living for the poor in the winter. It has been given me to help, to comfort, and strengthen the little flock there and to call in many wanderers; and my soul is filled with these things from my rising up till my lying down. My life is too short, and God\u2019s work is too great for me to think of making a home for myself in this world. I\u2019ve not turned a deaf ear to your words, Seth, for when I saw as your love was given to me, I thought it might be a leading of Providence for me to change my way of life, and that we should be fellow-helpers; and I spread the matter before the Lord. But whenever I tried to fix my mind on marriage, and our living together, other thoughts always came in\u2014the times when I\u2019ve prayed by the sick and dying, and the happy hours I\u2019ve had preaching, when my heart was filled with love, and the Word was given to me abundantly. And when I\u2019ve opened the Bible for direction, I\u2019ve always lighted on some clear word to tell me where my work lay. I believe what you say, Seth, that you would try to be a help and not a hindrance to my work; but I see that our marriage is not God\u2019s will\u2014He draws my heart another way. I desire to live and die without husband or children. I seem to have no room in my soul for wants and fears of my own, it has pleased God to fill my heart so full with the wants and sufferings of his poor people.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Seth was unable to reply, and they walked on in silence. At last, as they were nearly at the yard-gate, he said, \u201cWell, Dinah, I must seek for strength to bear it, and to endure as seeing Him who is invisible. But I feel now how weak my faith is. It seems as if, when you are gone, I could never joy in anything any more. I think it\u2019s something passing the love of women as I feel for you, for I could be content without your marrying me if I could go and live at Snowfield and be near you. I trusted as the strong love God has given me towards you was a leading for us both; but it seems it was only meant for my trial. Perhaps I feel more for you than I ought to feel for any creature, for I often can\u2019t help saying of you what the hymn says\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  In darkest shades if she appear,     My dawning is begun; She is my soul\u2019s bright morning-star,     And she my rising sun.

Do nothing without the Lord\u2019s clear bidding. It\u2019s a bleak and barren country there, not like this land of Goshen you\u2019ve been used to.

There may be a new leading.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet us leave that, Seth. It\u2019s good to live only a moment at a time, as I\u2019ve read in one of Mr. Wesley\u2019s books. It isn\u2019t for you and me to lay plans; we\u2019ve nothing to do but to obey and to trust. Farewell.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Dinah pressed his hand with rather a sad look in her loving eyes, and then passed through the gate, while Seth turned away to walk lingeringly home. But instead of taking the direct road, he chose to turn back along the fields through which he and Dinah had already passed; and I think his blue linen handkerchief was very wet with tears long before he had made up his mind that it was time for him to set his face steadily homewards. He was but three-and-twenty, and had only just learned what it is to love\u2014to love with that adoration which a young man gives to a woman whom he feels to be greater and better than himself. Love of this sort is hardly distinguishable from religious feeling. What deep and worthy love is so, whether of woman or child, or art or music. Our caresses, our tender words, our still rapture under the influence of autumn sunsets, or pillared vistas, or calm majestic statues, or Beethoven symphonies all bring with them the consciousness that they are mere waves and ripples in an unfathomable ocean of love and beauty; our emotion in its keenest moment passes from expression into silence, our love at its highest flood rushes beyond its object and loses itself in the sense of divine mystery. And this blessed gift of venerating love has been given to too many humble craftsmen since the world began for us to feel any surprise that it should have existed in the soul of a Methodist carpenter half a century ago, while there was yet a lingering after-glow from the time when Wesley and his fellow-labourer fed on the hips and haws of the Cornwall hedges, after exhausting limbs and lungs in carrying a divine message to the poor. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  That afterglow has long faded away; and the picture we are apt to make of Methodism in our imagination is not an amphitheatre of green hills, or the deep shade of broad-leaved sycamores, where a crowd of rough men and weary-hearted women drank in a faith which was a rudimentary culture, which linked their thoughts with the past, lifted their imagination above the sordid details of their own narrow lives, and suffused their souls with the sense of a pitying, loving, infinite Presence, sweet as summer to the houseless needy. It is too possible that to some of my readers Methodism may mean nothing more than low-pitched gables up dingy streets, sleek grocers, sponging preachers, and hypocritical jargon\u2014elements which are regarded as an exhaustive analysis of Methodism in many fashionable quarters. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  That would be a pity; for I cannot pretend that Seth and Dinah were anything else than Methodists\u2014not indeed of that modern type which reads quarterly reviews and attends in chapels with pillared porticoes, but of a very old-fashioned kind. They believed in present miracles, in instantaneous conversions, in revelations by dreams and visions; they drew lots, and sought for Divine guidance by opening the Bible at hazard; having a literal way of interpreting the Scriptures, which is not at all sanctioned by approved commentators; and it is impossible for me to represent their diction as correct, or their instruction as liberal. Still\u2014if I have read religious history aright\u2014faith, hope, and charity have not always been found in a direct ratio with a sensibility to the three concords, and it is possible\u2014thank Heaven!\u2014to have very erroneous theories and very sublime feelings. The raw bacon which clumsy Molly spares from her own scanty store that she may carry it to her neighbour\u2019s child to \u201cstop the fits,\u201d may be a piteously inefficacious remedy; but the generous stirring of neighbourly kindness that prompted the deed has a beneficent radiation that is not lost. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Considering these things, we can hardly think Dinah and Seth beneath our sympathy, accustomed as we may be to weep over the loftier sorrows of heroines in satin boots and crinoline, and of heroes riding fiery horses, themselves ridden by still more fiery passions. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Poor Seth! He was never on horseback in his life except once, when he was a little lad, and Mr. Jonathan Burge took him up behind, telling him to \u201chold on tight\u201d; and instead of bursting out into wild accusing apostrophes to God and destiny, he is resolving, as he now walks homewards under the solemn starlight, to repress his sadness, to be less bent on having his own will, and to live more for others, as Dinah does."))}y.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

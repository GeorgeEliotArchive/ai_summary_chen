But already some one else was astir in the house, and had gone downstairs, preceded by Gyp. The dog\u2019s pattering step was a sure sign that it was Adam who went down; but Dinah was not aware of this, and she thought it was more likely to be Seth, for he had told her how Adam had stayed up working the night before. Seth, however, had only just awakened at the sound of the opening door. The exciting influence of the previous day, heightened at last by Dinah\u2019s unexpected presence, had not been counteracted by any bodily weariness, for he had not done his ordinary amount of hard work; and so when he went to bed; it was not till he had tired himself with hours of tossing wakefulness that drowsiness came, and led on a heavier morning sleep than was usual with him. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  But Adam had been refreshed by his long rest, and with his habitual impatience of mere passivity, he was eager to begin the new day and subdue sadness by his strong will and strong arm. The white mist lay in the valley; it was going to be a bright warm day, and he would start to work again when he had had his breakfast. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing but what\u2019s bearable as long as a man can work,\u201d he said to himself; \u201cthe natur o\u2019 things doesn\u2019t change, though it seems as if one\u2019s own life was nothing but change. The square o\u2019 four is sixteen, and you must lengthen your lever in proportion to your weight, is as true when a man\u2019s miserable as when he\u2019s happy; and the best o\u2019 working is, it gives you a grip hold o\u2019 things outside your own lot.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  As he dashed the cold water over his head and face, he felt completely himself again, and with his black eyes as keen as ever and his thick black hair all glistening with the fresh moisture, he went into the workshop to look out the wood for his father\u2019s coffin, intending that he and Seth should carry it with them to Jonathan Burge\u2019s and have the coffin made by one of the workmen there, so that his mother might not see and hear the sad task going forward at home. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He had just gone into the workshop when his quick ear detected a light rapid foot on the stairs\u2014certainly not his mother\u2019s. He had been in bed and asleep when Dinah had come in, in the evening, and now he wondered whose step this could be. A foolish thought came, and moved him strangely. As if it could be Hetty! She was the last person likely to be in the house. And yet he felt reluctant to go and look and have the clear proof that it was some one else. He stood leaning on a plank he had taken hold of, listening to sounds which his imagination interpreted for him so pleasantly that the keen strong face became suffused with a timid tenderness. The light footstep moved about the kitchen, followed by the sound of the sweeping brush, hardly making so much noise as the lightest breeze that chases the autumn leaves along the dusty path; and Adam\u2019s imagination saw a dimpled face, with dark bright eyes and roguish smiles looking backward at this brush, and a rounded figure just leaning a little to clasp the handle. A very foolish thought\u2014it could not be Hetty; but the only way of dismissing such nonsense from his head was to go and see ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"who")," it was, for his fancy only got nearer and nearer to belief while he stood there listening. He loosed the plank and went to the kitchen door. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHow do you do, Adam Bede?\u201d said Dinah, in her calm treble, pausing from her sweeping and fixing her mild grave eyes upon him. \u201cI trust you feel rested and strengthened again to bear the burden and heat of the day.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It was like dreaming of the sunshine and awaking in the moonlight. Adam had seen Dinah several times, but always at the Hall Farm, where he was not very vividly conscious of any woman\u2019s presence except Hetty\u2019s, and he had only in the last day or two begun to suspect that Seth was in love with her, so that his attention had not hitherto been drawn towards her for his brother\u2019s sake. But now her slim figure, her plain black gown, and her pale serene face impressed him with all the force that belongs to a reality contrasted with a preoccupying fancy. For the first moment or two he made no answer, but looked at her with the concentrated, examining glance which a man gives to an object in which he has suddenly begun to be interested. Dinah, for the first time in her life, felt a painful self-consciousness; there was something in the dark penetrating glance of this strong man so different from the mildness and timidity of his brother Seth. A faint blush came, which deepened as she wondered at it. This blush recalled Adam from his forgetfulness. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI was quite taken by surprise; it was very good of you to come and see my mother in her trouble,\u201d he said, in a gentle grateful tone, for his quick mind told him at once how she came to be there. \u201cI hope my mother was thankful to have you,\u201d he added, wondering rather anxiously what had been Dinah\u2019s reception. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Dinah, resuming her work, \u201cshe seemed greatly comforted after a while, and she\u2019s had a good deal of rest in the night, by times. She was fast asleep when I left her.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWho was it took the news to the Hall Farm?\u201d said Adam, his thoughts reverting to some one there; he wondered whether ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"she")," had felt anything about it. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt was Mr. Irwine, the clergyman, told me, and my aunt was grieved for your mother when she heard it, and wanted me to come; and so is my uncle, I\u2019m sure, now he\u2019s heard it, but he was gone out to Rosseter all yesterday. They\u2019ll look for you there as soon as you\u2019ve got time to go, for there\u2019s nobody round that hearth but what\u2019s glad to see you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Dinah, with her sympathetic divination, knew quite well that Adam was longing to hear if Hetty had said anything about their trouble; she was too rigorously truthful for benevolent invention, but she had contrived to say something in which Hetty was tacitly included. Love has a way of cheating itself consciously, like a child who plays at solitary hide-and-seek; it is pleased with assurances that it all the while disbelieves. Adam liked what Dinah had said so much that his mind was directly full of the next visit he should pay to the Hall Farm, when Hetty would perhaps behave more kindly to him than she had ever done before. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut you won\u2019t be there yourself any longer?\u201d he said to Dinah. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, I go back to Snowfield on Saturday, and I shall have to set out to Treddleston early, to be in time for the Oakbourne carrier. So I must go back to the farm to-night, that I may have the last day with my aunt and her children. But I can stay here all to-day, if your mother would like me; and her heart seemed inclined towards me last night.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, then, she\u2019s sure to want you to-day. If mother takes to people at the beginning, she\u2019s sure to get fond of \u2019em; but she\u2019s a strange way of not liking young women. Though, to be sure,\u201d Adam went on, smiling, \u201cher not liking other young women is no reason why she shouldn\u2019t like you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hitherto Gyp had been assisting at this conversation in motionless silence, seated on his haunches, and alternately looking up in his master\u2019s face to watch its expression and observing Dinah\u2019s movements about the kitchen. The kind smile with which Adam uttered the last words was apparently decisive with Gyp of the light in which the stranger was to be regarded, and as she turned round after putting aside her sweeping-brush, he trotted towards her and put up his muzzle against her hand in a friendly way. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou see Gyp bids you welcome,\u201d said Adam, \u201cand he\u2019s very slow to welcome strangers.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cPoor dog!\u201d said Dinah, patting the rough grey coat, \u201cI\u2019ve a strange feeling about the dumb things as if they wanted to speak, and it was a trouble to \u2019em because they couldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t help being sorry for the dogs always, though perhaps there\u2019s no need. But they may well have more in them than they know how to make us understand, for we can\u2019t say half what we feel, with all our words.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Seth came down now, and was pleased to find Adam talking with Dinah; he wanted Adam to know how much better she was than all other women. But after a few words of greeting, Adam drew him into the workshop to consult about the coffin, and Dinah went on with her cleaning. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  By six o\u2019clock they were all at breakfast with Lisbeth in a kitchen as clean as she could have made it herself. The window and door were open, and the morning air brought with it a mingled scent of southernwood, thyme, and sweet-briar from the patch of garden by the side of the cottage. Dinah did not sit down at first, but moved about, serving the others with the warm porridge and the toasted oat-cake, which she had got ready in the usual way, for she had asked Seth to tell her just what his mother gave them for breakfast. Lisbeth had been unusually silent since she came downstairs, apparently requiring some time to adjust her ideas to a state of things in which she came down like a lady to find all the work done, and sat still to be waited on. Her new sensations seemed to exclude the remembrance of her grief. At last, after tasting the porridge, she broke silence: "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYe might ha\u2019 made the parridge worse,\u201d she said to Dinah; \u201cI can ate it wi\u2019out its turnin\u2019 my stomach.

And then he says in some o\u2019 those counties it\u2019s as flat as the back o\u2019 your hand, and you can see nothing of a distance without climbing up the highest trees. I couldn\u2019t abide that.

I\u2019ll go to the village this forenoon, because Mr. Burge \u2019ull want to see me, and Seth shall stay at home and begin the coffin. I can come back at noon, and then he can go.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, nay,\u201d persisted Lisbeth, beginning to cry, \u201cI\u2019n set my heart on\u2019t as thee shalt ma\u2019 thy feyther\u2019s coffin. Thee\u2019t so stiff an\u2019 masterful, thee\u2019t ne\u2019er do as thy mother wants thee. Thee wast often angered wi\u2019 thy feyther when he war alive; thee must be the better to him now he\u2019s gone. He\u2019d ha\u2019 thought nothin\u2019 on\u2019t for Seth to ma\u2019s coffin.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSay no more, Adam, say no more,\u201d said Seth, gently, though his voice told that he spoke with some effort; \u201cMother\u2019s in the right. I\u2019ll go to work, and do thee stay at home.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He passed into the workshop immediately, followed by Adam; while Lisbeth, automatically obeying her old habits, began to put away the breakfast things, as if she did not mean Dinah to take her place any longer. Dinah said nothing, but presently used the opportunity of quietly joining the brothers in the workshop. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  They had already got on their aprons and paper caps, and Adam was standing with his left hand on Seth\u2019s shoulder, while he pointed with the hammer in his right to some boards which they were looking at. Their backs were turned towards the door by which Dinah entered, and she came in so gently that they were not aware of her presence till they heard her voice saying, \u201cSeth Bede!\u201d Seth started, and they both turned round. Dinah looked as if she did not see Adam, and fixed her eyes on Seth\u2019s face, saying with calm kindness, \u201cI won\u2019t say farewell. I shall see you again when you come from work. So as I\u2019m at the farm before dark, it will be quite soon enough.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThank you, Dinah; I should like to walk home with you once more. It\u2019ll perhaps be the last time.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  There was a little tremor in Seth\u2019s voice. Dinah put out her hand and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have sweet peace in your mind to-day, Seth, for your tenderness and long-suffering towards your aged mother.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  She turned round and left the workshop as quickly and quietly as she had entered it. Adam had been observing her closely all the while, but she had not looked at him. As soon as she was gone, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t wonder at thee for loving her, Seth. She\u2019s got a face like a lily.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Seth\u2019s soul rushed to his eyes and lips: he had never yet confessed his secret to Adam, but now he felt a delicious sense of disburdenment, as he answered, \u201cAye, Addy, I do love her\u2014too much, I doubt. But she doesna love me, lad, only as one child o\u2019 God loves another. She\u2019ll never love any man as a husband\u2014that\u2019s my belief.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, lad, there\u2019s no telling; thee mustna lose heart. She\u2019s made out o\u2019 stuff with a finer grain than most o\u2019 the women; I can see that clear enough. But if she\u2019s better than they are in other things, I canna think she\u2019ll fall short of \u2019em in loving.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  No more was said. Seth set out to the village, and Adam began his work on the coffin. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGod help the lad, and me too,\u201d he thought, as he lifted the board. \u201cWe\u2019re like enough to find life a tough job\u2014hard work inside and out. It\u2019s a strange thing to think of a man as can lift a chair with his teeth and walk fifty mile on end, trembling and turning hot and cold at only a look from one woman out of all the rest i\u2019 the world. It\u2019s a mystery we can give no account of; but no more we can of the sprouting o\u2019 the seed, for that matter.\u201d"))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

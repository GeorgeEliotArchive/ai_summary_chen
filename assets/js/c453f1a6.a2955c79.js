To account for this unprecedented apparition in aunt Pullet\u2019s parlour, we must return to the moment when the three children went to play out of doors, and the small demons who had taken possession of Maggie\u2019s soul at an early period of the day had returned in all the greater force after a temporary absence. All the disagreeable recollections of the morning were thick upon her, when Tom, whose displeasure toward her had been considerably refreshed by her foolish trick of causing him to upset his cowslip wine, said, \u201cHere, Lucy, you come along with me,\u201d and walked off to the area where the toads were, as if there were no Maggie in existence. Seeing this, Maggie lingered at a distance, looking like a small Medusa with her snakes cropped. Lucy was naturally pleased that cousin Tom was so good to her, and it was very amusing to see him tickling a fat toad with a piece of string when the toad was safe down the area, with an iron grating over him. Still Lucy wished Maggie to enjoy the spectacle also, especially as she would doubtless find a name for the toad, and say what had been his past history; for Lucy had a delighted semi-belief in Maggie\u2019s stories about the live things they came upon by accident,\u2014how Mrs Earwig had a wash at home, and one of her children had fallen into the hot copper, for which reason she was running so fast to fetch the doctor. Tom had a profound contempt for this nonsense of Maggie\u2019s, smashing the earwig at once as a superfluous yet easy means of proving the entire unreality of such a story; but Lucy, for the life of her, could not help fancying there was something in it, and at all events thought it was very pretty make-believe. So now the desire to know the history of a very portly toad, added to her habitual affectionateness, made her run back to Maggie and say, \u201cOh, there is such a big, funny toad, Maggie! Do come and see!\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie said nothing, but turned away from her with a deeper frown. As long as Tom seemed to prefer Lucy to her, Lucy made part of his unkindness. Maggie would have thought a little while ago that she could never be cross with pretty little Lucy, any more than she could be cruel to a little white mouse; but then, Tom had always been quite indifferent to Lucy before, and it had been left to Maggie to pet and make much of her. As it was, she was actually beginning to think that she should like to make Lucy cry by slapping or pinching her, especially as it might vex Tom, whom it was of no use to slap, even if she dared, because he didn\u2019t mind it. And if Lucy hadn\u2019t been there, Maggie was sure he would have got friends with her sooner. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tickling a fat toad who is not highly sensitive is an amusement that it is possible to exhaust, and Tom by and by began to look round for some other mode of passing the time. But in so prim a garden, where they were not to go off the paved walks, there was not a great choice of sport. The only great pleasure such a restriction suggested was the pleasure of breaking it, and Tom began to meditate an insurrectionary visit to the pond, about a field\u2019s length beyond the garden. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI say, Lucy,\u201d he began, nodding his head up and down with great significance, as he coiled up his string again, \u201cwhat do you think I mean to do?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat, Tom?\u201d said Lucy, with curiosity.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, never mind; they won\u2019t be cross with ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you"),",\u201d said Tom. \u201cYou say I took you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom walked along, and Lucy trotted by his side, timidly enjoying the rare treat of doing something naughty,\u2014excited also by the mention of that celebrity, the pike, about which she was quite uncertain whether it was a fish or a fowl. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie saw them leaving the garden, and could not resist the impulse to follow. Anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their objects than love, and that Tom and Lucy should do or see anything of which she was ignorant would have been an intolerable idea to Maggie. So she kept a few yards behind them, unobserved by Tom, who was presently absorbed in watching for the pike,\u2014a highly interesting monster; he was said to be so very old, so very large, and to have such a remarkable appetite. The pike, like other celebrities, did not show when he was watched for, but Tom caught sight of something in rapid movement in the water, which attracted him to another spot on the brink of the pond. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHere, Lucy!\u201d he said in a loud whisper, \u201ccome here! take care! keep on the grass!\u2014don\u2019t step where the cows have been!\u201d he added, pointing to a peninsula of dry grass, with trodden mud on each side of it; for Tom\u2019s contemptuous conception of a girl included the attribute of being unfit to walk in dirty places. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Lucy came carefully as she was bidden, and bent down to look at what seemed a golden arrow-head darting through the water. It was a water-snake, Tom told her; and Lucy at last could see the serpentine wave of its body, very much wondering that a snake could swim. Maggie had drawn nearer and nearer; she ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"must")," see it too, though it was bitter to her, like everything else, since Tom did not care about her seeing it. At last she was close by Lucy; and Tom, who had been aware of her approach, but would not notice it till he was obliged, turned round and said,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow, get away, Maggie; there\u2019s no room for you on the grass here. Nobody asked ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you")," to come.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There were passions at war in Maggie at that moment to have made a tragedy, if tragedies were made by passion only; but the essential \u03c4\u03b9 \u03bc\u1f73\u03b3\u03b5\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 which was present in the passion was wanting to the action; the utmost Maggie could do, with a fierce thrust of her small brown arm, was to push poor little pink-and-white Lucy into the cow-trodden mud. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Then Tom could not restrain himself, and gave Maggie two smart slaps on the arm as he ran to pick up Lucy, who lay crying helplessly. Maggie retreated to the roots of a tree a few yards off, and looked on impenitently. Usually her repentance came quickly after one rash deed, but now Tom and Lucy had made her so miserable, she was glad to spoil their happiness,\u2014glad to make everybody uncomfortable. Why should she be sorry? Tom was very slow to forgive ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her"),", however sorry she might have been. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI shall tell mother, you know, Miss Mag,\u201d said Tom, loudly and emphatically, as soon as Lucy was up and ready to walk away. It was not Tom\u2019s practice to \u201ctell,\u201d but here justice clearly demanded that Maggie should be visited with the utmost punishment; not that Tom had learned to put his views in that abstract form; he never mentioned \u201cjustice,\u201d and had no idea that his desire to punish might be called by that fine name. Lucy was too entirely absorbed by the evil that had befallen her,\u2014the spoiling of her pretty best clothes, and the discomfort of being wet and dirty,\u2014to think much of the cause, which was entirely mysterious to her. She could never have guessed what she had done to make Maggie angry with her; but she felt that Maggie was very unkind and disagreeable, and made no magnanimous entreaties to Tom that he would not \u201ctell,\u201d only running along by his side and crying piteously, while Maggie sat on the roots of the tree and looked after them with her small Medusa face. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSally,\u201d said Tom, when they reached the kitchen door, and Sally looked at them in speechless amaze, with a piece of bread-and-butter in her mouth and a toasting-fork in her hand,\u2014\u201cSally, tell mother it was Maggie pushed Lucy into the mud.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut Lors ha\u2019 massy, how did you get near such mud as that?\u201d said Sally, making a wry face, as she stooped down and examined the ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"corpus delicti"),". "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom\u2019s imagination had not been rapid and capacious enough to include this question among the foreseen consequences, but it was no sooner put than he foresaw whither it tended, and that Maggie would not be considered the only culprit in the case. He walked quietly away from the kitchen door, leaving Sally to that pleasure of guessing which active minds notoriously prefer to ready-made knowledge. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Sally, as you are aware, lost no time in presenting Lucy at the parlour door, for to have so dirty an object introduced into the house at Garum Firs was too great a weight to be sustained by a single mind. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGoodness gracious!\u201d aunt Pullet exclaimed, after preluding by an inarticulate scream; \u201ckeep her at the door, Sally! Don\u2019t bring her off the oil-cloth, whatever you do.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, she\u2019s tumbled into some nasty mud,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, going up to Lucy to examine into the amount of damage to clothes for which she felt herself responsible to her sister Deane. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIf you please, \u2019um, it was Miss Maggie as pushed her in,\u201d said Sally; \u201cMaster Tom\u2019s been and said so, and they must ha\u2019 been to the pond, for it\u2019s only there they could ha\u2019 got into such dirt.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere it is, Bessy; it\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling you,\u201d said Mrs Pullet, in a tone of prophetic sadness; \u201cit\u2019s your children,\u2014there\u2019s no knowing what they\u2019ll come to.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver was mute, feeling herself a truly wretched mother. As usual, the thought pressed upon her that people would think she had done something wicked to deserve her maternal troubles, while Mrs Pullet began to give elaborate directions to Sally how to guard the premises from serious injury in the course of removing the dirt. Meantime tea was to be brought in by the cook, and the two naughty children were to have theirs in an ignominious manner in the kitchen. Mrs Tulliver went out to speak to these naughty children, supposing them to be close at hand; but it was not until after some search that she found Tom leaning with rather a hardened, careless air against the white paling of the poultry-yard, and lowering his piece of string on the other side as a means of exasperating the turkey-cock. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTom, you naughty boy, where\u2019s your sister?\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, in a distressed voice. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Tom; his eagerness for justice on Maggie had diminished since he had seen clearly that it could hardly be brought about without the injustice of some blame on his own conduct. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, where did you leave her?\u201d said the mother, looking round. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSitting under the tree, against the pond,\u201d said Tom, apparently indifferent to everything but the string and the turkey-cock. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThen go and fetch her in this minute, you naughty boy. And how could you think o\u2019 going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was dirt? You know she\u2019ll do mischief if there\u2019s mischief to be done.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It was Mrs Tulliver\u2019s way, if she blamed Tom, to refer his misdemeanour, somehow or other, to Maggie. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The idea of Maggie sitting alone by the pond roused an habitual fear in Mrs Tulliver\u2019s mind, and she mounted the horse-block to satisfy herself by a sight of that fatal child, while Tom walked\u2014not very quickly\u2014on his way toward her. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThey\u2019re such children for the water, mine are,\u201d she said aloud, without reflecting that there was no one to hear her; \u201cthey\u2019ll be brought in dead and drownded some day. I wish that river was far enough.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But when she not only failed to discern Maggie, but presently saw Tom returning from the pool alone, this hovering fear entered and took complete possession of her, and she hurried to meet him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMaggie\u2019s nowhere about the pond, mother,\u201d said Tom; \u201cshe\u2019s gone away.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  You may conceive the terrified search for Maggie, and the difficulty of convincing her mother that she was not in the pond. Mrs Pullet observed that the child might come to a worse end if she lived, there was no knowing; and Mr Pullet, confused and overwhelmed by this revolutionary aspect of things,\u2014the tea deferred and the poultry alarmed by the unusual running to and fro,\u2014took up his spud as an instrument of search, and reached down a key to unlock the goose-pen, as a likely place for Maggie to lie concealed in. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom, after a while, started the idea that Maggie was gone home (without thinking it necessary to state that it was what he should have done himself under the circumstances), and the suggestion was seized as a comfort by his mother.

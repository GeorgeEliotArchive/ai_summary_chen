But it happens, on the contrary, that my strongest effort is to avoid any such arbitrary picture, and to give a faithful account of men and things as they have mirrored themselves in my mind. The mirror is doubtless defective, the outlines will sometimes be disturbed, the reflection faint or confused; but I feel as much bound to tell you as precisely as I can what that reflection is, as if I were in the witness-box, narrating my experience on oath.

Ten to one, you would have thought him a tasteless, indiscreet, methodistical man. It is so very rarely that facts hit that nice medium required by our own enlightened opinions and refined taste! Perhaps you will say, \u201cDo improve the facts a little, then; make them more accordant with those correct views which it is our privilege to possess. The world is not just what we like; do touch it up with a tasteful pencil, and make believe it is not quite such a mixed entangled affair.

With your neighbour, Mrs. Green, who was really kind to you in your last illness, but has said several ill-natured things about you since your convalescence? Nay, with your excellent husband himself, who has other irritating habits besides that of not wiping his shoes?

Falsehood is so easy, truth so difficult. The pencil is conscious of a delightful facility in drawing a griffin\u2014the longer the claws, and the larger the wings, the better; but that marvellous facility which we mistook for genius is apt to forsake us when we want to draw a real unexaggerated lion. Examine your words well, and you will find that even when you have no motive to be false, it is a very hard thing to say the exact truth, even about your own immediate feelings\u2014much harder than to say something fine about them which is ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"not")," the exact truth. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It is for this rare, precious quality of truthfulness that I delight in many Dutch paintings, which lofty-minded people despise. I find a source of delicious sympathy in these faithful pictures of a monotonous homely existence, which has been the fate of so many more among my fellow-mortals than a life of pomp or of absolute indigence, of tragic suffering or of world-stirring actions. I turn, without shrinking, from cloud-borne angels, from prophets, sibyls, and heroic warriors, to an old woman bending over her flower-pot, or eating her solitary dinner, while the noonday light, softened perhaps by a screen of leaves, falls on her mob-cap, and just touches the rim of her spinning-wheel, and her stone jug, and all those cheap common things which are the precious necessaries of life to her\u2014or I turn to that village wedding, kept between four brown walls, where an awkward bridegroom opens the dance with a high-shouldered, broad-faced bride, while elderly and middle-aged friends look on, with very irregular noses and lips, and probably with quart-pots in their hands, but with an expression of unmistakable contentment and goodwill. \u201cFoh!\u201d says my idealistic friend, \u201cwhat vulgar details!

I am not at all sure that the majority of the human race have not been ugly, and even among those \u201clords of their kind,\u201d the British, squat figures, ill-shapen nostrils, and dingy complexions are not startling exceptions. Yet there is a great deal of family love amongst us. I have a friend or two whose class of features is such that the Apollo curl on the summit of their brows would be decidedly trying; yet to my certain knowledge tender hearts have beaten for them, and their miniatures\u2014flattering, but still not lovely\u2014are kissed in secret by motherly lips. I have seen many an excellent matron, who could have never in her best days have been handsome, and yet she had a packet of yellow love-letters in a private drawer, and sweet children showered kisses on her sallow cheeks. And I believe there have been plenty of young heroes, of middle stature and feeble beards, who have felt quite sure they could never love anything more insignificant than a Diana, and yet have found themselves in middle life happily settled with a wife who waddles. Yes! Thank God; human feeling is like the mighty rivers that bless the earth: it does not wait for beauty\u2014it flows with resistless force and brings beauty with it. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  All honour and reverence to the divine beauty of form! Let us cultivate it to the utmost in men, women, and children\u2014in our gardens and in our houses. But let us love that other beauty too, which lies in no secret of proportion, but in the secret of deep human sympathy. Paint us an angel, if you can, with a floating violet robe, and a face paled by the celestial light; paint us yet oftener a Madonna, turning her mild face upward and opening her arms to welcome the divine glory; but do not impose on us any aesthetic rules which shall banish from the region of Art those old women scraping carrots with their work-worn hands, those heavy clowns taking holiday in a dingy pot-house, those rounded backs and stupid weather-beaten faces that have bent over the spade and done the rough work of the world\u2014those homes with their tin pans, their brown pitchers, their rough curs, and their clusters of onions. In this world there are so many of these common coarse people, who have no picturesque sentimental wretchedness! It is so needful we should remember their existence, else we may happen to leave them quite out of our religion and philosophy and frame lofty theories which only fit a world of extremes. Therefore, let Art always remind us of them; therefore let us always have men ready to give the loving pains of a life to the faithful representing of commonplace things\u2014men who see beauty in these commonplace things, and delight in showing how kindly the light of heaven falls on them. There are few prophets in the world; few sublimely beautiful women; few heroes. I can\u2019t afford to give all my love and reverence to such rarities: I want a great deal of those feelings for my every-day fellow-men, especially for the few in the foreground of the great multitude, whose faces I know, whose hands I touch, for whom I have to make way with kindly courtesy. Neither are picturesque lazzaroni or romantic criminals half so frequent as your common labourer, who gets his own bread and eats it vulgarly but creditably with his own pocket-knife. It is more needful that I should have a fibre of sympathy connecting me with that vulgar citizen who weighs out my sugar in a vilely assorted cravat and waistcoat, than with the handsomest rascal in red scarf and green feathers\u2014more needful that my heart should swell with loving admiration at some trait of gentle goodness in the faulty people who sit at the same hearth with me, or in the clergyman of my own parish, who is perhaps rather too corpulent and in other respects is not an Oberlin or a Tillotson, than at the deeds of heroes whom I shall never know except by hearsay, or at the sublimest abstract of all clerical graces that was ever conceived by an able novelist. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  And so I come back to Mr. Irwine, with whom I desire you to be in perfect charity, far as he may be from satisfying your demands on the clerical character. Perhaps you think he was not\u2014as he ought to have been\u2014a living demonstration of the benefits attached to a national church? But I am not sure of that; at least I know that the people in Broxton and Hayslope would have been very sorry to part with their clergyman, and that most faces brightened at his approach; and until it can be proved that hatred is a better thing for the soul than love, I must believe that Mr. Irwine\u2019s influence in his parish was a more wholesome one than that of the zealous Mr. Ryde, who came there twenty years afterwards, when Mr. Irwine had been gathered to his fathers. It is true, Mr. Ryde insisted strongly on the doctrines of the Reformation, visited his flock a great deal in their own homes, and was severe in rebuking the aberrations of the flesh\u2014put a stop, indeed, to the Christmas rounds of the church singers, as promoting drunkenness and too light a handling of sacred things. But I gathered from Adam Bede, to whom I talked of these matters in his old age, that few clergymen could be less successful in winning the hearts of their parishioners than Mr. Ryde. They learned a great many notions about doctrine from him, so that almost every church-goer under fifty began to distinguish as well between the genuine gospel and what did not come precisely up to that standard, as if he had been born and bred a Dissenter; and for some time after his arrival there seemed to be quite a religious movement in that quiet rural district. \u201cBut,\u201d said Adam, \u201cI\u2019ve seen pretty clear, ever since I was a young un, as religion\u2019s something else besides notions. It isn\u2019t notions sets people doing the right thing\u2014it\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s the same with the notions in religion as it is with math\u2019matics\u2014a man may be able to work problems straight off in\u2019s head as he sits by the fire and smokes his pipe, but if he has to make a machine or a building, he must have a will and a resolution and love something else better than his own ease. Somehow, the congregation began to fall off, and people began to speak light o\u2019 Mr. Ryde. I believe he meant right at bottom; but, you see, he was sourish-tempered, and was for beating down prices with the people as worked for him; and his preaching wouldn\u2019t go down well with that sauce. And he wanted to be like my lord judge i\u2019 the parish, punishing folks for doing wrong; and he scolded \u2019em from the pulpit as if he\u2019d been a Ranter, and yet he couldn\u2019t abide the Dissenters, and was a deal more set against \u2019em than Mr. Irwine was. And then he didn\u2019t keep within his income, for he seemed to think at first go-off that six hundred a-year was to make him as big a man as Mr. Donnithorne. That\u2019s a sore mischief I\u2019ve often seen with the poor curates jumping into a bit of a living all of a sudden. Mr. Ryde was a deal thought on at a distance, I believe, and he wrote books, but as for math\u2019matics and the natur o\u2019 things, he was as ignorant as a woman. He was very knowing about doctrines, and used to call \u2019em the bulwarks of the Reformation; but I\u2019ve always mistrusted that sort o\u2019 learning as leaves folks foolish and unreasonable about business. Now Mester Irwine was as different as could be: as quick!\u2014he understood what you meant in a minute, and he knew all about building, and could see when you\u2019d made a good job. And he behaved as much like a gentleman to the farmers, and th\u2019 old women, and the labourers, as he did to the gentry. You never saw ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"him")," interfering and scolding, and trying to play th\u2019 emperor. Ah, he was a fine man as ever you set eyes on; and so kind to\u2019s mother and sisters. That poor sickly Miss Anne\u2014he seemed to think more of her than of anybody else in the world. There wasn\u2019t a soul in the parish had a word to say against him; and his servants stayed with him till they were so old and pottering, he had to hire other folks to do their work.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cthat was an excellent way of preaching in the weekdays; but I daresay, if your old friend Mr. Irwine were to come to life again, and get into the pulpit next Sunday, you would be rather ashamed that he didn\u2019t preach better after all your praise of him.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, nay,\u201d said Adam, broadening his chest and throwing himself back in his chair, as if he were ready to meet all inferences, \u201cnobody has ever heard me say Mr. Irwine was much of a preacher. He didn\u2019t go into deep speritial experience; and I know there s a deal in a man\u2019s inward life as you can\u2019t measure by the square, and say, \u2018Do this and that \u2019ll follow,\u2019 and, \u2018Do that and this \u2019ll follow.\u2019 There\u2019s things go on in the soul, and times when feelings come into you like a rushing mighty wind, as the Scripture says, and part your life in two a\u2019most, so you look back on yourself as if you was somebody else. Those are things as you can\u2019t bottle up in a \u2018do this\u2019 and \u2018do that\u2019; and I\u2019ll go so far with the strongest Methodist ever you\u2019ll find. That shows me there\u2019s deep speritial things in religion. You can\u2019t make much out wi\u2019 talking about it, but you feel it. Mr. Irwine didn\u2019t go into those things\u2014he preached short moral sermons, and that was all. But then he acted pretty much up to what he said; he didn\u2019t set up for being so different from other folks one day, and then be as like \u2019em as two peas the next. And he made folks love him and respect him, and that was better nor stirring up their gall wi\u2019 being overbusy. Mrs. Poyser used to say\u2014you know she would have her word about everything\u2014she said, Mr. Irwine was like a good meal o\u2019 victual, you were the better for him without thinking on it, and Mr. Ryde was like a dose o\u2019 physic, he gripped you and worreted you, and after all he left you much the same.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut didn\u2019t Mr. Ryde preach a great deal more about that spiritual part of religion that you talk of, Adam? Couldn\u2019t you get more out of his sermons than out of Mr. Irwine\u2019s?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cEh, I knowna. He preached a deal about doctrines. But I\u2019ve seen pretty clear, ever since I was a young un, as religion\u2019s something else besides doctrines and notions. I look at it as if the doctrines was like finding names for your feelings, so as you can talk of \u2019em when you\u2019ve never known \u2019em, just as a man may talk o\u2019 tools when he knows their names, though he\u2019s never so much as seen \u2019em, still less handled \u2019em. I\u2019ve heard a deal o\u2019 doctrine i\u2019 my time, for I used to go after the Dissenting preachers along wi\u2019 Seth, when I was a lad o\u2019 seventeen, and got puzzling myself a deal about th\u2019 Arminians and the Calvinists. The Wesleyans, you know, are strong Arminians; and Seth, who could never abide anything harsh and was always for hoping the best, held fast by the Wesleyans from the very first; but I thought I could pick a hole or two in their notions, and I got disputing wi\u2019 one o\u2019 the class leaders down at Treddles\u2019on, and harassed him so, first o\u2019 this side and then o\u2019 that, till at last he said, \u2018Young man, it\u2019s the devil making use o\u2019 your pride and conceit as a weapon to war against the simplicity o\u2019 the truth.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t help laughing then, but as I was going home, I thought the man wasn\u2019t far wrong. I began to see as all this weighing and sifting what this text means and that text means, and whether folks are saved all by God\u2019s grace, or whether there goes an ounce o\u2019 their own will to\u2019t, was no part o\u2019 real religion at all. You may talk o\u2019 these things for hours on end, and you\u2019ll only be all the more coxy and conceited for\u2019t. So I took to going nowhere but to church, and hearing nobody but Mr. Irwine, for he said nothing but what was good and what you\u2019d be the wiser for remembering. And I found it better for my soul to be humble before the mysteries o\u2019 God\u2019s dealings, and not be making a clatter about what I could never understand. And they\u2019re poor foolish questions after all; for what have we got either inside or outside of us but what comes from God? If we\u2019ve got a resolution to do right, He gave it us, I reckon, first or last; but I see plain enough we shall never do it without a resolution, and that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam, you perceive, was a warm admirer, perhaps a partial judge, of Mr. Irwine, as, happily, some of us still are of the people we have known familiarly. Doubtless it will be despised as a weakness by that lofty order of minds who pant after the ideal, and are oppressed by a general sense that their emotions are of too exquisite a character to find fit objects among their everyday fellowmen. I have often been favoured with the confidence of these select natures, and find them to concur in the experience that great men are overestimated and small men are insupportable; that if you would love a woman without ever looking back on your love as a folly, she must die while you are courting her; and if you would maintain the slightest belief in human heroism, you must never make a pilgrimage to see the hero. I confess I have often meanly shrunk from confessing to these accomplished and acute gentlemen what my own experience has been. I am afraid I have often smiled with hypocritical assent, and gratified them with an epigram on the fleeting nature of our illusions, which any one moderately acquainted with French literature can command at a moment\u2019s notice. Human converse, I think some wise man has remarked, is not rigidly sincere. But I herewith discharge my conscience, and declare that I have had quite enthusiastic movements of admiration towards old gentlemen who spoke the worst English, who were occasionally fretful in their temper, and who had never moved in a higher sphere of influence than that of parish overseer; and that the way in which I have come to the conclusion that human nature is lovable\u2014the way I have learnt something of its deep pathos, its sublime mysteries\u2014has been by living a great deal among people more or less commonplace and vulgar, of whom you would perhaps hear nothing very surprising if you were to inquire about them in the neighbourhoods where they dwelt. Ten to one most of the small shopkeepers in their vicinity saw nothing at all in them. For I have observed this remarkable coincidence, that the select natures who pant after the ideal, and find nothing in pantaloons or petticoats great enough to command their reverence and love, are curiously in unison with the narrowest and pettiest. For example, I have often heard Mr. Gedge, the landlord of the Royal Oak, who used to turn a bloodshot eye on his neighbours in the village of Shepperton, sum up his opinion of the people in his own parish\u2014and they were all the people he knew\u2014in these emphatic words: \u201cAye, sir, I\u2019ve said it often, and I\u2019ll say it again, they\u2019re a poor lot i\u2019 this parish\u2014a poor lot, sir, big and little.\u201d I think he had a dim idea that if he could migrate to a distant parish, he might find neighbours worthy of him; and indeed he did subsequently transfer himself to the Saracen\u2019s Head, which was doing a thriving business in the back street of a neighbouring market-town. But, oddly enough, he has found the people up that back street of precisely the same stamp as the inhabitants of Shepperton\u2014\u201ca poor lot, sir, big and little, and them as comes for a go o\u2019 gin are no better than them as comes for a pint o\u2019 twopenny\u2014a poor lot.\u201d"))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

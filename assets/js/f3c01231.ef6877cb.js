Yet Romola\u2019s life seemed an image of that loving, pitying devotedness, that patient endurance of irksome tasks, from which he had shrunk and excused himself. But he was not out of love with goodness, or prepared to plunge into vice: he was in his fresh youth, with soft pulses for all charm and loveliness; he had still a healthy appetite for ordinary human joys, and the poison could only work by degrees. He had sold himself to evil, but at present life seemed so nearly the same to him that he was not conscious of the bond. He meant all things to go on as they had done before, both within and without him: he meant to win golden opinions by meritorious exertion, by ingenious learning, by amiable compliance: he was not going to do anything that would throw him out of harmony with the beings he cared for. And he cared supremely for Romola; he wished to have her for his beautiful and loving wife. There might be a wealthier alliance within the ultimate reach of successful accomplishments like his, but there was no woman in all Florence like Romola.

Wherefore, my Tito, I think it not well that we should let slip the occasion that lies under our hands. And now we will turn back to the point where we have cited the passage from Thucydides, and I wish you, by way of preliminary, to go with me through all my notes on the Latin translation made by Lorenzo Valla, for which the incomparable Pope Nicholas the Fifth\u2014with whose personal notice I was honoured while I was yet young, and when he was still Thomas of Sarzana\u2014paid him (I say not unduly) the sum of five hundred gold scudi. But inasmuch as Valla, though otherwise of dubious fame, is held in high honour for his severe scholarship, whence the epigrammatist has jocosely said of him that since he went among the shades, Pluto himself has not dared to speak in the ancient languages, it is the more needful that his name should not be as a stamp warranting false wares; and therefore I would introduce an ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"excursus")," on Thucydides, wherein my castigations of Valla\u2019s text may find a fitting place.

Three rows of pearls and a lower necklace of gold reposed on the horizontal cushion of her neck; the embroidered border of her trailing black velvet gown and her embroidered long-drooping sleeves of rose-coloured damask, were slightly faded, but they conveyed to the initiated eye the satisfactory assurance that they were the splendid result of six months\u2019 labour by a skilled workman; and the rose-coloured petticoat, with its dimmed white fringe and seed-pearl arabesques, was duly exhibited in order to suggest a similar pleasing reflection. A handsome coral rosary hung from one side of an inferential belt, which emerged into certainty with a large clasp of silver wrought in niello; and, on the other side, where the belt again became inferential, hung a scarsella, or large purse, of crimson velvet, stitched with pearls.

And half the people invited were ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Piagnoni"),"\u2014they call them ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Piagnoni")," (funeral mourners: properly, paid mourners) now, these new saints of Fra Girolamo\u2019s making. And to think of two families like the Albizzi and the Acciajoli taking up such notions, when they could afford to wear the best! Well, well, they invited me\u2014but they could do no other, seeing my husband was Luca Antonio\u2019s uncle by the mother\u2019s side\u2014and a pretty time I had of it while we waited under the canopy in front of the house, before they let us in. I couldn\u2019t stand in my clothes, it seemed, without giving offence; for there was Monna Berta, who has had worse secrets in her time than any I could tell of myself, looking askance at me from under her hood like a ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"pinzochera"),", (a Sister of the Third Order of Saint Francis: an uncloistered nun) and telling me to read the Frate\u2019s book about widows, from which she had found great guidance. Holy Madonna! it seems as if widows had nothing to do now but to buy their coffins, and think it a thousand years till they get into them, instead of enjoying themselves a little when they\u2019ve got their hands free for the first time. And what do you think was the music we had, to make our dinner lively? A long discourse from Fra Domenico of San Marco, about the doctrines of their blessed Fra Girolamo\u2014the three doctrines we are all to get by heart; and he kept marking them off on his fingers till he made my flesh creep: and the first is, Florence, or the Church\u2014I don\u2019t know which, for first he said one and then the other\u2014shall be scourged; but if he means the pestilence, the Signory ought to put a stop to such preaching, for it\u2019s enough to raise the swelling under one\u2019s arms with fright: but then, after that, he says Florence is to be regenerated; but what will be the good of that when we\u2019re all dead of the plague, or something else? And then, the third thing, and what he said oftenest, is, that it\u2019s all to be in our days: and he marked that off on his thumb, till he made me tremble like the very jelly before me. They had jellies, to be sure, with the arms of the Albizzi and the Acciajoli raised on them in all colours; they\u2019ve not turned the world quite upside down yet. But all their talk is, that we are to go back to the old ways: for up starts Francesco Valori, that I\u2019ve danced with in the Via Larga when he was a bachelor and as fond of the Medici as anybody, and he makes a speech about the old times, before the Florentines had left off crying \u2018Popolo\u2019 and begun to cry \u2018Palle\u2019\u2014as if that had anything to do with a wedding!\u2014and how we ought to keep to the rules the Signory laid down heaven knows when, that we were not to wear this and that, and not to eat this and that\u2014and how our manners were corrupted and we read bad books; though he can\u2019t say that of ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"me"),"\u2014\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cStop, cousin!\u201d said Bardo, in his imperious tone, for he had a remark to make, and only desperate measures could arrest the rattling lengthiness of Monna Brigida\u2019s discourse.

But it is true, Tito, that our manners have degenerated somewhat from that noble frugality which, as has been well seen in the public acts of our citizens, is the parent of true magnificence. For men, as I hear, will now spend on the transient show of a Giostra sums which would suffice to found a library, and confer a lasting possession on mankind. Still, I conceive, it remains true of us Florentines that we have more of that magnanimous sobriety which abhors a trivial lavishness that it may be grandly open-handed on grand occasions, than can be found in any other city of Italy; for I understand that the Neapolitan and Milanese courtiers laugh at the scarcity of our plate, and think scorn of our great families for borrowing from each other that furniture of the table at their entertainments.

Perhaps I never told you about it, Messer Tito?\u2014it almost freezes my blood when I think of it.

"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"  It was an event much thought of in the village. All Mr. Burge\u2019s men had a holiday, and all Mr. Poyser\u2019s, and most of those who had a holiday appeared in their best clothes at the wedding. I think there was hardly an inhabitant of Hayslope specially mentioned in this history and still resident in the parish on this November morning who was not either in church to see Adam and Dinah married, or near the church door to greet them as they came forth. Mrs. Irwine and her daughters were waiting at the churchyard gates in their carriage (for they had a carriage now) to shake hands with the bride and bridegroom and wish them well; and in the absence of Miss Lydia Donnithorne at Bath, Mrs. Best, Mr. Mills, and Mr. Craig had felt it incumbent on them to represent \u201cthe family\u201d at the Chase on the occasion. The churchyard walk was quite lined with familiar faces, many of them faces that had first looked at Dinah when she preached on the Green. And no wonder they showed this eager interest on her marriage morning, for nothing like Dinah and the history which had brought her and Adam Bede together had been known at Hayslope within the memory of man. "),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"  Bessy Cranage, in her neatest cap and frock, was crying, though she did not exactly know why; for, as her cousin Wiry Ben, who stood near her, judiciously suggested, Dinah was not going away, and if Bessy was in low spirits, the best thing for her to do was to follow Dinah\u2019s example and marry an honest fellow who was ready to have her. Next to Bessy, just within the church door, there were the Poyser children, peeping round the corner of the pews to get a sight of the mysterious ceremony; Totty\u2019s face wearing an unusual air of anxiety at the idea of seeing cousin Dinah come back looking rather old, for in Totty\u2019s experience no married people were young. "),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"  I envy them all the sight they had when the marriage was fairly ended and Adam led Dinah out of church. She was not in black this morning, for her Aunt Poyser would by no means allow such a risk of incurring bad luck, and had herself made a present of the wedding dress, made all of grey, though in the usual Quaker form, for on this point Dinah could not give way. So the lily face looked out with sweet gravity from under a grey Quaker bonnet, neither smiling nor blushing, but with lips trembling a little under the weight of solemn feelings. Adam, as he pressed her arm to his side, walked with his old erectness and his head thrown rather backward as if to face all the world better. But it was not because he was particularly proud this morning, as is the wont of bridegrooms, for his happiness was of a kind that had little reference to men\u2019s opinion of it. There was a tinge of sadness in his deep joy; Dinah knew it, and did not feel aggrieved. "),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"  There were three other couples, following the bride and bridegroom: first, Martin Poyser, looking as cheery as a bright fire on this rimy morning, led quiet Mary Burge, the bridesmaid; then came Seth serenely happy, with Mrs. Poyser on his arm; and last of all Bartle Massey, with Lisbeth\u2014Lisbeth in a new gown and bonnet, too busy with her pride in her son and her delight in possessing the one daughter she had desired to devise a single pretext for complaint. "),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"  Bartle Massey had consented to attend the wedding at Adam\u2019s earnest request, under protest against marriage in general and the marriage of a sensible man in particular. Nevertheless, Mr. Poyser had a joke against him after the wedding dinner, to the effect that in the vestry he had given the bride one more kiss than was necessary. "),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"  Behind this last couple came Mr. Irwine, glad at heart over this good morning\u2019s work of joining Adam and Dinah. For he had seen Adam in the worst moments of his sorrow; and what better harvest from that painful seed-time could there be than this? The love that had brought hope and comfort in the hour of despair, the love that had found its way to the dark prison cell and to poor Hetty\u2019s darker soul\u2014this strong gentle love was to be Adam\u2019s companion and helper till death. "),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"  There was much shaking of hands mingled with \u201cGod bless you\u2019s\u201d and other good wishes to the four couples, at the churchyard gate, Mr. Poyser answering for the rest with unwonted vivacity of tongue, for he had all the appropriate wedding-day jokes at his command. And the women, he observed, could never do anything but put finger in eye at a wedding. Even Mrs. Poyser could not trust herself to speak as the neighbours shook hands with her, and Lisbeth began to cry in the face of the very first person who told her she was getting young again. "),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"  Mr. Joshua Rann, having a slight touch of rheumatism, did not join in the ringing of the bells this morning, and, looking on with some contempt at these informal greetings which required no official co-operation from the clerk, began to hum in his musical bass, \u201cOh what a joyful thing it is,\u201d by way of preluding a little to the effect he intended to produce in the wedding psalm next Sunday. "),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat\u2019s a bit of good news to cheer Arthur,\u201d said Mr. Irwine to his mother, as they drove off. \u201cI shall write to him the first thing when we get home.\u201d"))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

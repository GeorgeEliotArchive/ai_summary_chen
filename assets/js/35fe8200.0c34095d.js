He had the letter in his pocket, and was anxious to have an opportunity of talking to Hetty alone. He could not see her face at church, for she had changed her seat, and when he came up to her to shake hands, her manner was doubtful and constrained. He expected this, for it was the first time she had met him since she had been aware that he had seen her with Arthur in the Grove. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCome, you\u2019ll go on with us, Adam,\u201d Mr. Poyser said when they reached the turning; and as soon as they were in the fields Adam ventured to offer his arm to Hetty. The children soon gave them an opportunity of lingering behind a little, and then Adam said: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWill you contrive for me to walk out in the garden a bit with you this evening, if it keeps fine, Hetty? I\u2019ve something partic\u2019lar to talk to you about.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty said, \u201cVery well.\u201d She was really as anxious as Adam was that she should have some private talk with him. She wondered what he thought of her and Arthur. He must have seen them kissing, she knew, but she had no conception of the scene that had taken place between Arthur and Adam. Her first feeling had been that Adam would be very angry with her, and perhaps would tell her aunt and uncle, but it never entered her mind that he would dare to say anything to Captain Donnithorne. It was a relief to her that he behaved so kindly to her to-day, and wanted to speak to ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her")," alone; for she had trembled when she found he was going home with them lest he should mean \u201cto tell.\u201d But, now he wanted to talk to her by herself, she should learn what he thought and what he meant to do. She felt a certain confidence that she could persuade him not to do anything she did not want him to do; she could perhaps even make him believe that she didn\u2019t care for Arthur; and as long as Adam thought there was any hope of her having him, he would do just what she liked, she knew. Besides, she ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"must")," go on seeming to encourage Adam, lest her uncle and aunt should be angry and suspect her of having some secret lover. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty\u2019s little brain was busy with this combination as she hung on Adam\u2019s arm and said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to some slight observations of his about the many hawthorn-berries there would be for the birds this next winter, and the low-hanging clouds that would hardly hold up till morning. And when they rejoined her aunt and uncle, she could pursue her thoughts without interruption, for Mr. Poyser held that though a young man might like to have the woman he was courting on his arm, he would nevertheless be glad of a little reasonable talk about business the while; and, for his own part, he was curious to hear the most recent news about the Chase Farm. So, through the rest of the walk, he claimed Adam\u2019s conversation for himself, and Hetty laid her small plots and imagined her little scenes of cunning blandishment, as she walked along by the hedgerows on honest Adam\u2019s arm, quite as well as if she had been an elegantly clad coquette alone in her boudoir. For if a country beauty in clumsy shoes be only shallow-hearted enough, it is astonishing how closely her mental processes may resemble those of a lady in society and crinoline, who applies her refined intellect to the problem of committing indiscretions without compromising herself. Perhaps the resemblance was not much the less because Hetty felt very unhappy all the while. The parting with Arthur was a double pain to her\u2014mingling with the tumult of passion and vanity there was a dim undefined fear that the future might shape itself in some way quite unlike her dream. She clung to the comforting hopeful words Arthur had uttered in their last meeting\u2014\u201cI shall come again at Christmas, and then we will see what can be done.\u201d She clung to the belief that he was so fond of her, he would never be happy without her; and she still hugged her secret\u2014that a great gentleman loved her\u2014with gratified pride, as a superiority over all the girls she knew. But the uncertainty of the future, the possibilities to which she could give no shape, began to press upon her like the invisible weight of air; she was alone on her little island of dreams, and all around her was the dark unknown water where Arthur was gone. She could gather no elation of spirits now by looking forward, but only by looking backward to build confidence on past words and caresses. But occasionally, since Thursday evening, her dim anxieties had been almost lost behind the more definite fear that Adam might betray what he knew to her uncle and aunt, and his sudden proposition to talk with her alone had set her thoughts to work in a new way. She was eager not to lose this evening\u2019s opportunity; and after tea, when the boys were going into the garden and Totty begged to go with them, Hetty said, with an alacrity that surprised Mrs. Poyser, \u201cI\u2019ll go with her, Aunt.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It did not seem at all surprising that Adam said he would go too, and soon he and Hetty were left alone together on the walk by the filbert-trees, while the boys were busy elsewhere gathering the large unripe nuts to play at \u201ccob-nut\u201d with, and Totty was watching them with a puppylike air of contemplation. It was but a short time\u2014hardly two months\u2014since Adam had had his mind filled with delicious hopes as he stood by Hetty\u2019s side in this garden. The remembrance of that scene had often been with him since Thursday evening: the sunlight through the apple-tree boughs, the red bunches, Hetty\u2019s sweet blush. It came importunately now, on this sad evening, with the low-hanging clouds, but he tried to suppress it, lest some emotion should impel him to say more than was needful for Hetty\u2019s sake. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAfter what I saw on Thursday night, Hetty,\u201d he began, \u201cyou won\u2019t think me making too free in what I\u2019m going to say. If you was being courted by any man as \u2019ud make you his wife, and I\u2019d known you was fond of him and meant to have him, I should have no right to speak a word to you about it; but when I see you\u2019re being made love to by a gentleman as can never marry you, and doesna think o\u2019 marrying you, I feel bound t\u2019 interfere for you. I can\u2019t speak about it to them as are i\u2019 the place o\u2019 your parents, for that might bring worse trouble than\u2019s needful.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam\u2019s words relieved one of Hetty\u2019s fears, but they also carried a meaning which sickened her with a strengthened foreboding. She was pale and trembling, and yet she would have angrily contradicted Adam, if she had dared to betray her feelings. But she was silent. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019re so young, you know, Hetty,\u201d he went on, almost tenderly, \u201cand y\u2019 haven\u2019t seen much o\u2019 what goes on in the world. It\u2019s right for me to do what I can to save you from getting into trouble for want o\u2019 your knowing where you\u2019re being led to. If anybody besides me knew what I know about your meeting a gentleman and having fine presents from him, they\u2019d speak light on you, and you\u2019d lose your character. And besides that, you\u2019ll have to suffer in your feelings, wi\u2019 giving your love to a man as can never marry you, so as he might take care of you all your life.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam paused and looked at Hetty, who was plucking the leaves from the filbert-trees and tearing them up in her hand. Her little plans and preconcerted speeches had all forsaken her, like an ill-learnt lesson, under the terrible agitation produced by Adam\u2019s words. There was a cruel force in their calm certainty which threatened to grapple and crush her flimsy hopes and fancies. She wanted to resist them\u2014she wanted to throw them off with angry contradiction\u2014but the determination to conceal what she felt still governed her. It was nothing more than a blind prompting now, for she was unable to calculate the effect of her words. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019ve no right to say as I love him,\u201d she said, faintly, but impetuously, plucking another rough leaf and tearing it up. She was very beautiful in her paleness and agitation, with her dark childish eyes dilated and her breath shorter than usual. Adam\u2019s heart yearned over her as he looked at her. Ah, if he could but comfort her, and soothe her, and save her from this pain; if he had but some sort of strength that would enable him to rescue her poor troubled mind, as he would have rescued her body in the face of all danger! "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI doubt it must be so, Hetty,\u201d he said, tenderly; \u201cfor I canna believe you\u2019d let any man kiss you by yourselves, and give you a gold box with his hair, and go a-walking i\u2019 the Grove to meet him, if you didna love him. I\u2019m not blaming you, for I know it \u2019ud begin by little and little, till at last you\u2019d not be able to throw it off. It\u2019s him I blame for stealing your love i\u2019 that way, when he knew he could never make you the right amends. He\u2019s been trifling with you, and making a plaything of you, and caring nothing about you as a man ought to care.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, he does care for me; I know better nor you,\u201d Hetty burst out. Everything was forgotten but the pain and anger she felt at Adam\u2019s words. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, Hetty,\u201d said Adam, \u201cif he\u2019d cared for you rightly, he\u2019d never ha\u2019 behaved so. He told me himself he meant nothing by his kissing and presents, and he wanted to make me believe as you thought light of \u2019em too. But I know better nor that. I can\u2019t help thinking as you\u2019ve been trusting to his loving you well enough to marry you, for all he\u2019s a gentleman. And that\u2019s why I must speak to you about it, Hetty, for fear you should be deceiving yourself. It\u2019s never entered his head the thought o\u2019 marrying you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHow do you know? How durst you say so?\u201d said Hetty, pausing in her walk and trembling. The terrible decision of Adam\u2019s tone shook her with fear. She had no presence of mind left for the reflection that Arthur would have his reasons for not telling the truth to Adam. Her words and look were enough to determine Adam: he must give her the letter. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cPerhaps you can\u2019t believe me, Hetty, because you think too well of him\u2014because you think he loves you better than he does. But I\u2019ve got a letter i\u2019 my pocket, as he wrote himself for me to give you. I\u2019ve not read the letter, but he says he\u2019s told you the truth in it. But before I give you the letter, consider, Hetty, and don\u2019t let it take too much hold on you. It wouldna ha\u2019 been good for you if he\u2019d wanted to do such a mad thing as marry you: it \u2019ud ha\u2019 led to no happiness i\u2019 th\u2019 end.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty said nothing; she felt a revival of hope at the mention of a letter which Adam had not read. There would be something quite different in it from what he thought. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam took out the letter, but he held it in his hand still, while he said, in a tone of tender entreaty, \u201cDon\u2019t you bear me ill will, Hetty, because I\u2019m the means o\u2019 bringing you this pain. God knows I\u2019d ha\u2019 borne a good deal worse for the sake o\u2019 sparing it you. And think\u2014there\u2019s nobody but me knows about this, and I\u2019ll take care of you as if I was your brother. You\u2019re the same as ever to me, for I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve done any wrong knowingly.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty had laid her hand on the letter, but Adam did not loose it till he had done speaking. She took no notice of what he said\u2014she had not listened; but when he loosed the letter, she put it into her pocket, without opening it, and then began to walk more quickly, as if she wanted to go in. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019re in the right not to read it just yet,\u201d said Adam. \u201cRead it when you\u2019re by yourself. But stay out a little bit longer, and let us call the children: you look so white and ill, your aunt may take notice of it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty heard the warning. It recalled to her the necessity of rallying her native powers of concealment, which had half given way under the shock of Adam\u2019s words. And she had the letter in her pocket: she was sure there was comfort in that letter in spite of Adam. She ran to find Totty, and soon reappeared with recovered colour, leading Totty, who was making a sour face because she had been obliged to throw away an unripe apple that she had set her small teeth in. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHegh, Totty,\u201d said Adam, \u201ccome and ride on my shoulder\u2014ever so high\u2014you\u2019ll touch the tops o\u2019 the trees.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  What little child ever refused to be comforted by that glorious sense of being seized strongly and swung upward? I don\u2019t believe Ganymede cried when the eagle carried him away, and perhaps deposited him on Jove\u2019s shoulder at the end. Totty smiled down complacently from her secure height, and pleasant was the sight to the mother\u2019s eyes, as she stood at the house door and saw Adam coming with his small burden. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBless your sweet face, my pet,\u201d she said, the mother\u2019s strong love filling her keen eyes with mildness, as Totty leaned forward and put out her arms. She had no eyes for Hetty at that moment, and only said, without looking at her, \u201cYou go and draw some ale, Hetty; the gells are both at the cheese.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  After the ale had been drawn and her uncle\u2019s pipe lighted, there was Totty to be taken to bed, and brought down again in her night-gown because she would cry instead of going to sleep. Then there was supper to be got ready, and Hetty must be continually in the way to give help. Adam stayed till he knew Mrs. Poyser expected him to go, engaging her and her husband in talk as constantly as he could, for the sake of leaving Hetty more at ease. He lingered, because he wanted to see her safely through that evening, and he was delighted to find how much self-command she showed. He knew she had not had time to read the letter, but he did not know she was buoyed up by a secret hope that the letter would contradict everything he had said. It was hard work for him to leave her\u2014hard to think that he should not know for days how she was bearing her trouble. But he must go at last, and all he could do was to press her hand gently as he said \u201cGood-bye,\u201d and hope she would take that as a sign that if his love could ever be a refuge for her, it was there the same as ever. How busy his thoughts were, as he walked home, in devising pitying excuses for her folly, in referring all her weakness to the sweet lovingness of her nature, in blaming Arthur, with less and less inclination to admit that ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"his")," conduct might be extenuated too! His exasperation at Hetty\u2019s suffering\u2014and also at the sense that she was possibly thrust for ever out of his own reach\u2014deafened him to any plea for the miscalled friend who had wrought this misery. Adam was a clear-sighted, fair-minded man\u2014a fine fellow, indeed, morally as well as physically. But if Aristides the Just was ever in love and jealous, he was at that moment not perfectly magnanimous. And I cannot pretend that Adam, in these painful days, felt nothing but righteous indignation and loving pity. He was bitterly jealous, and in proportion as his love made him indulgent in his judgment of Hetty, the bitterness found a vent in his feeling towards Arthur. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHer head was allays likely to be turned,\u201d he thought, \u201cwhen a gentleman, with his fine manners, and fine clothes, and his white hands, and that way o\u2019 talking gentlefolks have, came about her, making up to her in a bold way, as a man couldn\u2019t do that was only her equal; and it\u2019s much if she\u2019ll ever like a common man now.\u201d He could not help drawing his own hands out of his pocket and looking at them\u2014at the hard palms and the broken finger-nails. \u201cI\u2019m a roughish fellow, altogether; I don\u2019t know, now I come to think on\u2019t, what there is much for a woman to like about me; and yet I might ha\u2019 got another wife easy enough, if I hadn\u2019t set my heart on her. But it\u2019s little matter what other women think about me, if she can\u2019t love me. She might ha\u2019 loved me, perhaps, as likely as any other man\u2014there\u2019s nobody hereabouts as I\u2019m afraid of, if ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"he")," hadn\u2019t come between us; but now I shall belike be hateful to her because I\u2019m so different to him. And yet there\u2019s no telling\u2014she may turn round the other way, when she finds he\u2019s made light of her all the while. She may come to feel the vally of a man as \u2019ud be thankful to be bound to her all his life. But I must put up with it whichever way it is\u2014I\u2019ve only to be thankful it\u2019s been no worse. I am not th\u2019 only man that\u2019s got to do without much happiness i\u2019 this life. There\u2019s many a good bit o\u2019 work done with a bad heart. It\u2019s God\u2019s will, and that\u2019s enough for us: we shouldn\u2019t know better how things ought to be than He does, I reckon, if we was to spend our lives i\u2019 puzzling. But it \u2019ud ha\u2019 gone near to spoil my work for me, if I\u2019d seen her brought to sorrow and shame, and through the man as I\u2019ve always been proud to think on. Since I\u2019ve been spared that, I\u2019ve no right to grumble. When a man\u2019s got his limbs whole, he can bear a smart cut or two.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  As Adam was getting over a stile at this point in his reflections, he perceived a man walking along the field before him. He knew it was Seth, returning from an evening preaching, and made haste to overtake him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI thought thee\u2019dst be at home before me,\u201d he said, as Seth turned round to wait for him, \u201cfor I\u2019m later than usual to-night.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, I\u2019m later too, for I got into talk, after meeting, with John Barnes, who has lately professed himself in a state of perfection, and I\u2019d a question to ask him about his experience. It\u2019s one o\u2019 them subjects that lead you further than y\u2019 expect\u2014they don\u2019t lie along the straight road.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  They walked along together in silence two or three minutes. Adam was not inclined to enter into the subtleties of religious experience, but he was inclined to interchange a word or two of brotherly affection and confidence with Seth. That was a rare impulse in him, much as the brothers loved each other. They hardly ever spoke of personal matters, or uttered more than an allusion to their family troubles. Adam was by nature reserved in all matters of feeling, and Seth felt a certain timidity towards his more practical brother. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSeth, lad,\u201d Adam said, putting his arm on his brother\u2019s shoulder, \u201chast heard anything from Dinah Morris since she went away?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Seth. \u201cShe told me I might write her word after a while, how we went on, and how mother bore up under her trouble. So I wrote to her a fortnight ago, and told her about thee having a new employment, and how Mother was more contented; and last Wednesday, when I called at the post at Treddles\u2019on, I found a letter from her. I think thee\u2019dst perhaps like to read it, but I didna say anything about it because thee\u2019st seemed so full of other things. It\u2019s quite easy t\u2019 read\u2014she writes wonderful for a woman.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Seth had drawn the letter from his pocket and held it out to Adam, who said, as he took it, \u201cAye, lad, I\u2019ve got a tough load to carry just now\u2014thee mustna take it ill if I\u2019m a bit silenter and crustier nor usual. Trouble doesna make me care the less for thee. I know we shall stick together to the last.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI take nought ill o\u2019 thee, Adam. I know well enough what it means if thee\u2019t a bit short wi\u2019 me now and then.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere\u2019s Mother opening the door to look out for us,\u201d said Adam, as they mounted the slope. \u201cShe\u2019s been sitting i\u2019 the dark as usual. Well, Gyp, well, art glad to see me?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Lisbeth went in again quickly and lighted a candle, for she had heard the welcome rustling of footsteps on the grass, before Gyp\u2019s joyful bark.

The daylight\u2019s long enough for me to stare i\u2019 the booke as I canna read. It \u2019ud be a fine way o\u2019 shortenin\u2019 the time, to make it waste the good candle. But which on you\u2019s for ha\u2019in\u2019 supper?

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ve had my supper,\u201d said Adam. \u201cHere, Gyp,\u201d he added, taking some cold potato from the table and rubbing the rough grey head that looked up towards him.

I found him i\u2019 the shop this forenoon, arter thee wast gone, a-sittin\u2019 an\u2019 doin\u2019 nothin\u2019\u2014not so much as a booke afore him.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHe\u2019s a deal o\u2019 work upon him just now, Mother,\u201d said Seth, \u201cand I think he\u2019s a bit troubled in his mind.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  DEAR BROTHER SETH\u2014Your letter lay three days beyond my knowing of it at the post, for I had not money enough by me to pay the carriage, this being a time of great need and sickness here, with the rains that have fallen, as if the windows of heaven were opened again; and to lay by money, from day to day, in such a time, when there are so many in present need of all things, would be a want of trust like the laying up of the manna. I speak of this, because I would not have you think me slow to answer, or that I had small joy in your rejoicing at the worldly good that has befallen your brother Adam. The honour and love you bear him is nothing but meet, for God has given him great gifts, and he uses them as the patriarch Joseph did, who, when he was exalted to a place of power and trust, yet yearned with tenderness towards his parent and his younger brother. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMy heart is knit to your aged mother since it was granted me to be near her in the day of trouble. Speak to her of me, and tell her I often bear her in my thoughts at evening time, when I am sitting in the dim light as I did with her, and we held one another\u2019s hands, and I spoke the words of comfort that were given to me. Ah, that is a blessed time, isn\u2019t it, Seth, when the outward light is fading, and the body is a little wearied with its work and its labour. Then the inward light shines the brighter, and we have a deeper sense of resting on the Divine strength. I sit on my chair in the dark room and close my eyes, and it is as if I was out of the body and could feel no want for evermore. For then, the very hardship, and the sorrow, and the blindness, and the sin I have beheld and been ready to weep over\u2014yea, all the anguish of the children of men, which sometimes wraps me round like sudden darkness\u2014I can bear with a willing pain, as if I was sharing the Redeemer\u2019s cross. For I feel it, I feel it\u2014infinite love is suffering too\u2014yea, in the fulness of knowledge it suffers, it yearns, it mourns; and that is a blind self-seeking which wants to be freed from the sorrow wherewith the whole creation groaneth and travaileth. Surely it is not true blessedness to be free from sorrow, while there is sorrow and sin in the world: sorrow is then a part of love, and love does not seek to throw it off. It is not the spirit only that tells me this\u2014I see it in the whole work and word of the Gospel. Is there not pleading in heaven? Is not the Man of Sorrows there in that crucified body wherewith he ascended? And is He not one with the Infinite Love itself\u2014as our love is one with our sorrow? "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThese thoughts have been much borne in on me of late, and I have seen with new clearness the meaning of those words, \u2018If any man love me, let him take up my cross.\u2019 I have heard this enlarged on as if it meant the troubles and persecutions we bring on ourselves by confessing Jesus. But surely that is a narrow thought. The true cross of the Redeemer was the sin and sorrow of this world\u2014",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"that")," was what lay heavy on his heart\u2014and that is the cross we shall share with him, that is the cup we must drink of with him, if we would have any part in that Divine Love which is one with his sorrow. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIn my outward lot, which you ask about, I have all things and abound. I have had constant work in the mill, though some of the other hands have been turned off for a time, and my body is greatly strengthened, so that I feel little weariness after long walking and speaking. What you say about staying in your own country with your mother and brother shows me that you have a true guidance; your lot is appointed there by a clear showing, and to seek a greater blessing elsewhere would be like laying a false offering on the altar and expecting the fire from heaven to kindle it. My work and my joy are here among the hills, and I sometimes think I cling too much to my life among the people here, and should be rebellious if I was called away. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI was thankful for your tidings about the dear friends at the Hall Farm, for though I sent them a letter, by my aunt\u2019s desire, after I came back from my sojourn among them, I have had no word from them. My aunt has not the pen of a ready writer, and the work of the house is sufficient for the day, for she is weak in body. My heart cleaves to her and her children as the nearest of all to me in the flesh\u2014yea, and to all in that house. I am carried away to them continually in my sleep, and often in the midst of work, and even of speech, the thought of them is borne in on me as if they were in need and trouble, which yet is dark to me. There may be some leading here; but I wait to be taught. You say they are all well. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWe shall see each other again in the body, I trust, though, it may be, not for a long while; for the brethren and sisters at Leeds are desirous to have me for a short space among them, when I have a door opened me again to leave Snowfield. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cFarewell, dear brother\u2014and yet not farewell. For those children of God whom it has been granted to see each other face to face, and to hold communion together, and to feel the same spirit working in both can never more be sundered though the hills may lie between. For their souls are enlarged for evermore by that union, and they bear one another about in their thoughts continually as it were a new strength.\u2014Your faithful Sister and fellow-worker in Christ, "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDINAH MORRIS.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI have not skill to write the words so small as you do and my pen moves slow.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHast read the letter?\u201d said Seth. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Adam. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I should ha\u2019 thought of her and her letter if I\u2019d never seen her: I daresay I should ha\u2019 thought a preaching woman hateful. But she\u2019s one as makes everything seem right she says and does, and I seemed to see her and hear her speaking when I read the letter. It\u2019s wonderful how I remember her looks and her voice. She\u2019d make thee rare and happy, Seth; she\u2019s just the woman for thee.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s no use thinking o\u2019 that,\u201d said Seth, despondingly. \u201cShe spoke so firm, and she\u2019s not the woman to say one thing and mean another.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, but her feelings may grow different.

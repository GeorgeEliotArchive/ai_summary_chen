Mr. Bates\u2019s turf, and gravel, and flower-beds were always at such a point of neatness and finish that nothing extraordinary could be done in the garden, except a little extraordinary scolding of the under-gardener, and this addition Mr. Bates did not neglect.

Over this embroidery she sat with cold lips and a palpitating heart, thankful that this miserable sensation throughout the daytime seemed to counteract the tendency to tears which returned with night and solitude.

Remembering that the dinner-hour was six, and that Lady Cheverel had desired her to be in the drawing-room early, she started up to dress, and was delighted to find herself feeling suddenly brave and strong. Curiosity to see Miss Assher--the thought that Anthony was in the house--the wish not to look unattractive, were feelings that brought some colour to her lips, and made it easy to attend to her toilette.

But when she heard him come in, and the scent of roses floated towards her, her heart gave one great leap.

Alas! you see what jealousy was doing in this poor young soul.

Caterina began to feel a choking sensation. She could see, almost without looking, that he was taking up her arm to examine her bracelet; their heads were bending close together, her curls touching his cheek--now he was putting his lips to her hand. Caterina felt her cheeks burn--she could sit no longer. She got up, pretended to be gliding about in search of something, and at length slipped out of the room.

She had hardly unfastened her hair, and thrown a loose gown about her, before there was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Sharp\u2019s voice said--\u2018Miss Tina, my lady wants to know if you\u2019re ill.\u2019 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Caterina opened the door and said, \u2018Thank you, dear Mrs. Sharp; I have a bad headache; please tell my lady I felt it come on after singing.\u2019 "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u2018Then, goodness me! why aren\u2019t you in bed, istid o\u2019 standing shivering there, fit to catch your death?

It was light enough for her to see about her room, for the moon, nearly at full, was riding high in the heavens among scattered hurrying clouds. Caterina drew aside the window-curtain; and, sitting with her forehead pressed against the cold pane, looked out on the wide stretch of park and lawn.

The stars were rushing in their eternal courses; the tides swelled to the level of the last expectant weed; the sun was making brilliant day to busy nations on the other side of the swift earth. The stream of human thought and deed was hurrying and broadening onward. The astronomer was at his telescope; the great ships were labouring over the waves; the toiling eagerness of commerce, the fierce spirit of revolution, were only ebbing in brief rest; and sleepless statesmen were dreading the possible crisis of the morrow. What were our little Tina and her trouble in this mighty torrent, rushing from one awful unknown to another? Lighter than the smallest centre of quivering life in the waterdrop, hidden and uncared for as the pulse of anguish in the breast of the tiniest bird that has fluttered down to its nest with the long-sought food, and has found the nest torn and empty."))}y.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

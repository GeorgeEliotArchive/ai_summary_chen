As for Maggie, she was peculiarly depressed this morning; she had been called up, after brief rest, at three o\u2019clock, and had that strange dreamy weariness which comes from watching in a sick-room through the chill hours of early twilight and breaking day,\u2014in which the outside day-light life seems to have no importance, and to be a mere margin to the hours in the darkened chamber. Their entrance interrupted the conversation. The shaking of hands was a melancholy and silent ceremony, till uncle Pullet observed, as Tom approached him: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, young sir, we\u2019ve been talking as we should want your pen and ink; you can write rarely now, after all your schooling, I should think.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, ay,\u201d said uncle Glegg, with admonition which he meant to be kind, \u201cwe must look to see the good of all this schooling, as your father\u2019s sunk so much money in, now,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("pre",null,(0,n.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre"},"   \u2018When land is gone and money\u2019s spent,      Then learning is most excellent.\u2019 \n")),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Now\u2019s the time, Tom, to let us see the good o\u2019 your learning.

But I doubt high living and high learning \u2019ull make it harder for you, young man, nor it was for me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut he must do it,\u201d interposed aunt Glegg, energetically, \u201cwhether it\u2019s hard or no. He hasn\u2019t got to consider what\u2019s hard; he must consider as he isn\u2019t to trusten to his friends to keep him in idleness and luxury; he\u2019s got to bear the fruits of his father\u2019s misconduct, and bring his mind to fare hard and to work hard. And he must be humble and grateful to his aunts and uncles for what they\u2019re doing for his mother and father, as must be turned out into the streets and go to the workhouse if they didn\u2019t help \u2019em. And his sister, too,\u201d continued Mrs Glegg, looking severely at Maggie, who had sat down on the sofa by her aunt Deane, drawn to her by the sense that she was Lucy\u2019s mother, \u201cshe must make up her mind to be humble and work; for there\u2019ll be no servants to wait on her any more,\u2014she must remember that.

There was a heightened colour in his face, and he was very far from looking humbled, but he was preparing to say, in a respectful tone, something he had previously meditated, when the door opened and his mother re-entered. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Poor Mrs Tulliver had in her hands a small tray, on which she had placed her silver teapot, a specimen teacup and saucer, the castors, and sugar-tongs. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSee here, sister,\u201d she said, looking at Mrs Deane, as she set the tray on the table, \u201cI thought, perhaps, if you looked at the teapot again,\u2014it\u2019s a good while since you saw it,\u2014you might like the pattern better; it makes beautiful tea, and there\u2019s a stand and everything; you might use it for every day, or else lay it by for Lucy when she goes to housekeeping. I should be so loath for \u2019em to buy it at the Golden Lion,\u201d said the poor woman, her heart swelling, and the tears coming,\u2014\u201cmy teapot as I bought when I was married, and to think of its being scratched, and set before the travellers and folks, and my letters on it,\u2014see here, E.

It was a remarkable manifestation of self-command and practical judgment in a lad of fifteen, that when his aunt Glegg ceased, he began to speak in a quiet and respectful manner, though with a good deal of trembling in his voice; for his mother\u2019s words had cut him to the quick.

Maggie, on the contrary, after her momentary delight in Tom\u2019s speech, had relapsed into her state of trembling indignation. Her mother had been standing close by Tom\u2019s side, and had been clinging to his arm ever since he had last spoken; Maggie suddenly started up and stood in front of them, her eyes flashing like the eyes of a young lioness.

Tom was vexed; it was no ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"use")," to talk so. The aunts were silent with surprise for some moments. At length, in a case of aberration such as this, comment presented itself as more expedient than any answer.

And I\u2019m sure he meant me to remember what he said that evening. I ought to obey my father\u2019s wish about his property.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Even Mrs Glegg could not withhold her approval from Tom\u2019s words; she felt that the Dodson blood was certainly speaking in him, though, if his father had been a Dodson, there would never have been this wicked alienation of money. Maggie would hardly have restrained herself from leaping on Tom\u2019s neck, if her aunt Moss had not prevented her by herself rising and taking Tom\u2019s hand, while she said, with rather a choked voice: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019ll never be the poorer for this, my dear boy, if there\u2019s a God above; and if the money\u2019s wanted for your father, Moss and me \u2019ull pay it, the same as if there was ever such security. We\u2019ll do as we\u2019d be done by; for if my children have got no other luck, they\u2019ve got an honest father and mother.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d said Mr Glegg, who had been meditating after Tom\u2019s words, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be doing any wrong by the creditors, supposing your father ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"was")," bankrupt. I\u2019ve been thinking o\u2019 that, for I\u2019ve been a creditor myself, and seen no end o\u2019 cheating. If he meant to give your aunt the money before ever he got into this sad work o\u2019 lawing, it\u2019s the same as if he\u2019d made away with the note himself; for he\u2019d made up his mind to be that much poorer. But there\u2019s a deal o\u2019 things to be considered, young man,\u201d Mr Glegg added, looking admonishingly at Tom, \u201cwhen you come to money business, and you may be taking one man\u2019s dinner away to make another man\u2019s breakfast. You don\u2019t understand that, I doubt?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Tom, decidedly. \u201cI know if I owe money to one man, I\u2019ve no right to give it to another. But if my father had made up his mind to give my aunt the money before he was in debt, he had a right to do it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell done, young man! I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d been so sharp,\u201d said uncle Glegg, with much candor. \u201cBut perhaps your father ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"did")," make away with the note. Let us go and see if we can find it in the chest.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s in my father\u2019s room. Let us go too, aunt Gritty,\u201d whispered Maggie."))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

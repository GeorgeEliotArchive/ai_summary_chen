"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI mean to go to Eagledale and fish for a week or so,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cI shall take you with me, Pym, and set off this morning; so be ready by half-past eleven.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The low whistle, which had assisted him in arriving at this resolution, here broke out into his loudest ringing tenor, and the corridor, as he hurried along it, echoed to his favourite song from the Beggar\u2019s Opera, \u201cWhen the heart of a man is oppressed with care.\u201d Not an heroic strain; nevertheless Arthur felt himself very heroic as he strode towards the stables to give his orders about the horses. His own approbation was necessary to him, and it was not an approbation to be enjoyed quite gratuitously; it must be won by a fair amount of merit. He had never yet forfeited that approbation, and he had considerable reliance on his own virtues. No young man could confess his faults more candidly; candour was one of his favourite virtues; and how can a man\u2019s candour be seen in all its lustre unless he has a few failings to talk of? But he had an agreeable confidence that his faults were all of a generous kind\u2014impetuous, warm-blooded, leonine; never crawling, crafty, reptilian. It was not possible for Arthur Donnithorne to do anything mean, dastardly, or cruel. \u201cNo! I\u2019m a devil of a fellow for getting myself into a hobble, but I always take care the load shall fall on my own shoulders.\u201d Unhappily, there is no inherent poetical justice in hobbles, and they will sometimes obstinately refuse to inflict their worst consequences on the prime offender, in spite of his loudly expressed wish. It was entirely owing to this deficiency in the scheme of things that Arthur had ever brought any one into trouble besides himself. He was nothing if not good-natured; and all his pictures of the future, when he should come into the estate, were made up of a prosperous, contented tenantry, adoring their landlord, who would be the model of an English gentleman\u2014mansion in first-rate order, all elegance and high taste\u2014jolly housekeeping, finest stud in Loamshire\u2014purse open to all public objects\u2014in short, everything as different as possible from what was now associated with the name of Donnithorne. And one of the first good actions he would perform in that future should be to increase Irwine\u2019s income for the vicarage of Hayslope, so that he might keep a carriage for his mother and sisters. His hearty affection for the rector dated from the age of frocks and trousers. It was an affection partly filial, partly fraternal\u2014fraternal enough to make him like Irwine\u2019s company better than that of most younger men, and filial enough to make him shrink strongly from incurring Irwine\u2019s disapprobation. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  You perceive that Arthur Donnithorne was \u201ca good fellow\u201d\u2014all his college friends thought him such. He couldn\u2019t bear to see any one uncomfortable; he would have been sorry even in his angriest moods for any harm to happen to his grandfather; and his Aunt Lydia herself had the benefit of that soft-heartedness which he bore towards the whole sex. Whether he would have self-mastery enough to be always as harmless and purely beneficent as his good-nature led him to desire, was a question that no one had yet decided against him; he was but twenty-one, you remember, and we don\u2019t inquire too closely into character in the case of a handsome generous young fellow, who will have property enough to support numerous peccadilloes\u2014who, if he should unfortunately break a man\u2019s legs in his rash driving, will be able to pension him handsomely; or if he should happen to spoil a woman\u2019s existence for her, will make it up to her with expensive ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"bon-bons"),", packed up and directed by his own hand. It would be ridiculous to be prying and analytic in such cases, as if one were inquiring into the character of a confidential clerk. We use round, general, gentlemanly epithets about a young man of birth and fortune; and ladies, with that fine intuition which is the distinguishing attribute of their sex, see at once that he is \u201cnice.\u201d The chances are that he will go through life without scandalizing any one; a seaworthy vessel that no one would refuse to insure. Ships, certainly, are liable to casualties, which sometimes make terribly evident some flaw in their construction that would never have been discoverable in smooth water; and many a \u201cgood fellow,\u201d through a disastrous combination of circumstances, has undergone a like betrayal. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But we have no fair ground for entertaining unfavourable auguries concerning Arthur Donnithorne, who this morning proves himself capable of a prudent resolution founded on conscience. One thing is clear: Nature has taken care that he shall never go far astray with perfect comfort and satisfaction to himself; he will never get beyond that border-land of sin, where he will be perpetually harassed by assaults from the other side of the boundary. He will never be a courtier of Vice, and wear her orders in his button-hole. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It was about ten o\u2019clock, and the sun was shining brilliantly; everything was looking lovelier for the yesterday\u2019s rain. It is a pleasant thing on such a morning to walk along the well-rolled gravel on one\u2019s way to the stables, meditating an excursion. But the scent of the stables, which, in a natural state of things, ought to be among the soothing influences of a man\u2019s life, always brought with it some irritation to Arthur. There was no having his own way in the stables; everything was managed in the stingiest fashion. His grandfather persisted in retaining as head groom an old dolt whom no sort of lever could move out of his old habits, and who was allowed to hire a succession of raw Loamshire lads as his subordinates, one of whom had lately tested a new pair of shears by clipping an oblong patch on Arthur\u2019s bay mare. This state of things is naturally embittering; one can put up with annoyances in the house, but to have the stable made a scene of vexation and disgust is a point beyond what human flesh and blood can be expected to endure long together without danger of misanthropy. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Old John\u2019s wooden, deep-wrinkled face was the first object that met Arthur\u2019s eyes as he entered the stable-yard, and it quite poisoned for him the bark of the two bloodhounds that kept watch there. He could never speak quite patiently to the old blockhead. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou must have Meg saddled for me and brought to the door at half-past eleven, and I shall want Rattler saddled for Pym at the same time. Do you hear?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, I hear, I hear, Cap\u2019n,\u201d said old John very deliberately, following the young master into the stable. John considered a young master as the natural enemy of an old servant, and young people in general as a poor contrivance for carrying on the world. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur went in for the sake of patting Meg, declining as far as possible to see anything in the stables, lest he should lose his temper before breakfast. The pretty creature was in one of the inner stables, and turned her mild head as her master came beside her. Little Trot, a tiny spaniel, her inseparable companion in the stable, was comfortably curled up on her back. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, Meg, my pretty girl,\u201d said Arthur, patting her neck, \u201cwe\u2019ll have a glorious canter this morning.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, your honour, I donna see as that can be,\u201d said John. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNot be? Why not?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, she\u2019s got lamed.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLamed, confound you!

You understand that there was a great deal of strong language, mingled with soothing \u201cwho-ho\u2019s\u201d while the leg was examined; that John stood by with quite as much emotion as if he had been a cunningly carved crab-tree walking-stick, and that Arthur Donnithorne presently repassed the iron gates of the pleasure-ground without singing as he went. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He considered himself thoroughly disappointed and annoyed. There was not another mount in the stable for himself and his servant besides Meg and Rattler. It was vexatious; just when he wanted to get out of the way for a week or two. It seemed culpable in Providence to allow such a combination of circumstances. To be shut up at the Chase with a broken arm when every other fellow in his regiment was enjoying himself at Windsor\u2014shut up with his grandfather, who had the same sort of affection for him as for his parchment deeds! And to be disgusted at every turn with the management of the house and the estate! In such circumstances a man necessarily gets in an ill humour, and works off the irritation by some excess or other. \u201cSalkeld would have drunk a bottle of port every day,\u201d he muttered to himself, \u201cbut I\u2019m not well seasoned enough for that. Well, since I can\u2019t go to Eagledale, I\u2019ll have a gallop on Rattler to Norburne this morning, and lunch with Gawaine.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Behind this explicit resolution there lay an implicit one. If he lunched with Gawaine and lingered chatting, he should not reach the Chase again till nearly five, when Hetty would be safe out of his sight in the housekeeper\u2019s room; and when she set out to go home, it would be his lazy time after dinner, so he should keep out of her way altogether. There really would have been no harm in being kind to the little thing, and it was worth dancing with a dozen ballroom belles only to look at Hetty for half an hour. But perhaps he had better not take any more notice of her; it might put notions into her head, as Irwine had hinted; though Arthur, for his part, thought girls were not by any means so soft and easily bruised; indeed, he had generally found them twice as cool and cunning as he was himself. As for any real harm in Hetty\u2019s case, it was out of the question: Arthur Donnithorne accepted his own bond for himself with perfect confidence. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  So the twelve o\u2019clock sun saw him galloping towards Norburne; and by good fortune Halsell Common lay in his road and gave him some fine leaps for Rattler. Nothing like \u201ctaking\u201d a few bushes and ditches for exorcising a demon; and it is really astonishing that the Centaurs, with their immense advantages in this way, have left so bad a reputation in history. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  After this, you will perhaps be surprised to hear that although Gawaine was at home, the hand of the dial in the courtyard had scarcely cleared the last stroke of three when Arthur returned through the entrance-gates, got down from the panting Rattler, and went into the house to take a hasty luncheon. But I believe there have been men since his day who have ridden a long way to avoid a rencontre, and then galloped hastily back lest they should miss it. It is the favourite stratagem of our passions to sham a retreat, and to turn sharp round upon us at the moment we have made up our minds that the day is our own. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThe cap\u2019n\u2019s been ridin\u2019 the devil\u2019s own pace,\u201d said Dalton the coachman, whose person stood out in high relief as he smoked his pipe against the stable wall, when John brought up Rattler. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAn\u2019 I wish he\u2019d get the devil to do\u2019s grooming for\u2019n,\u201d growled John. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAye; he\u2019d hev a deal haimabler groom nor what he has now,\u201d observed Dalton\u2014and the joke appeared to him so good that, being left alone upon the scene, he continued at intervals to take his pipe from his mouth in order to wink at an imaginary audience and shake luxuriously with a silent, ventral laughter, mentally rehearsing the dialogue from the beginning, that he might recite it with effect in the servants\u2019 hall. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  When Arthur went up to his dressing-room again after luncheon, it was inevitable that the debate he had had with himself there earlier in the day should flash across his mind; but it was impossible for him now to dwell on the remembrance\u2014impossible to recall the feelings and reflections which had been decisive with him then, any more than to recall the peculiar scent of the air that had freshened him when he first opened his window. The desire to see Hetty had rushed back like an ill-stemmed current; he was amazed himself at the force with which this trivial fancy seemed to grasp him: he was even rather tremulous as he brushed his hair\u2014pooh! it was riding in that break-neck way. It was because he had made a serious affair of an idle matter, by thinking of it as if it were of any consequence. He would amuse himself by seeing Hetty to-day, and get rid of the whole thing from his mind. It was all Irwine\u2019s fault. \u201cIf Irwine had said nothing, I shouldn\u2019t have thought half so much of Hetty as of Meg\u2019s lameness.\u201d However, it was just the sort of day for lolling in the Hermitage, and he would go and finish Dr. Moore\u2019s ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Zeluco")," there before dinner. The Hermitage stood in Fir-tree Grove\u2014the way Hetty was sure to come in walking from the Hall Farm. So nothing could be simpler and more natural: meeting Hetty was a mere circumstance of his walk, not its object. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur\u2019s shadow flitted rather faster among the sturdy oaks of the Chase than might have been expected from the shadow of a tired man on a warm afternoon, and it was still scarcely four o\u2019clock when he stood before the tall narrow gate leading into the delicious labyrinthine wood which skirted one side of the Chase, and which was called Fir-tree Grove, not because the firs were many, but because they were few. It was a wood of beeches and limes, with here and there a light silver-stemmed birch\u2014just the sort of wood most haunted by the nymphs: you see their white sunlit limbs gleaming athwart the boughs, or peeping from behind the smooth-sweeping outline of a tall lime; you hear their soft liquid laughter\u2014but if you look with a too curious sacrilegious eye, they vanish behind the silvery beeches, they make you believe that their voice was only a running brooklet, perhaps they metamorphose themselves into a tawny squirrel that scampers away and mocks you from the topmost bough. It was not a grove with measured grass or rolled gravel for you to tread upon, but with narrow, hollow-shaped, earthy paths, edged with faint dashes of delicate moss\u2014paths which look as if they were made by the free will of the trees and underwood, moving reverently aside to look at the tall queen of the white-footed nymphs. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It was along the broadest of these paths that Arthur Donnithorne passed, under an avenue of limes and beeches. It was a still afternoon\u2014the golden light was lingering languidly among the upper boughs, only glancing down here and there on the purple pathway and its edge of faintly sprinkled moss: an afternoon in which destiny disguises her cold awful face behind a hazy radiant veil, encloses us in warm downy wings, and poisons us with violet-scented breath. Arthur strolled along carelessly, with a book under his arm, but not looking on the ground as meditative men are apt to do; his eyes ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"would")," fix themselves on the distant bend in the road round which a little figure must surely appear before long. Ah! There she comes. First a bright patch of colour, like a tropic bird among the boughs; then a tripping figure, with a round hat on, and a small basket under her arm; then a deep-blushing, almost frightened, but bright-smiling girl, making her curtsy with a fluttered yet happy glance, as Arthur came up to her. If Arthur had had time to think at all, he would have thought it strange that he should feel fluttered too, be conscious of blushing too\u2014in fact, look and feel as foolish as if he had been taken by surprise instead of meeting just what he expected. Poor things! It was a pity they were not in that golden age of childhood when they would have stood face to face, eyeing each other with timid liking, then given each other a little butterfly kiss, and toddled off to play together. Arthur would have gone home to his silk-curtained cot, and Hetty to her home-spun pillow, and both would have slept without dreams, and to-morrow would have been a life hardly conscious of a yesterday. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur turned round and walked by Hetty\u2019s side without giving a reason. They were alone together for the first time. What an overpowering presence that first privacy is! He actually dared not look at this little butter-maker for the first minute or two. As for Hetty, her feet rested on a cloud, and she was borne along by warm zephyrs; she had forgotten her rose-coloured ribbons; she was no more conscious of her limbs than if her childish soul had passed into a water-lily, resting on a liquid bed and warmed by the midsummer sun-beams. It may seem a contradiction, but Arthur gathered a certain carelessness and confidence from his timidity: it was an entirely different state of mind from what he had expected in such a meeting with Hetty; and full as he was of vague feeling, there was room, in those moments of silence, for the thought that his previous debates and scruples were needless. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou are quite right to choose this way of coming to the Chase,\u201d he said at last, looking down at Hetty; \u201cit is so much prettier as well as shorter than coming by either of the lodges.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Hetty answered, with a tremulous, almost whispering voice. She didn\u2019t know one bit how to speak to a gentleman like Mr. Arthur, and her very vanity made her more coy of speech.

Then she felt ashamed to death that she was crying, and for one long instant her happiness was all gone. But in the next she felt an arm steal round her, and a gentle voice said, \u201cWhy, Hetty, what makes you cry? I didn\u2019t mean to vex you. I wouldn\u2019t vex you for the world, you little blossom. Come, don\u2019t cry; look at me, else I shall think you won\u2019t forgive me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur had laid his hand on the soft arm that was nearest to him, and was stooping towards Hetty with a look of coaxing entreaty. Hetty lifted her long dewy lashes, and met the eyes that were bent towards her with a sweet, timid, beseeching look. What a space of time those three moments were while their eyes met and his arms touched her! Love is such a simple thing when we have only one-and-twenty summers and a sweet girl of seventeen trembles under our glance, as if she were a bud first opening her heart with wondering rapture to the morning. Such young unfurrowed souls roll to meet each other like two velvet peaches that touch softly and are at rest; they mingle as easily as two brooklets that ask for nothing but to entwine themselves and ripple with ever-interlacing curves in the leafiest hiding-places. While Arthur gazed into Hetty\u2019s dark beseeching eyes, it made no difference to him what sort of English she spoke; and even if hoops and powder had been in fashion, he would very likely not have been sensible just then that Hetty wanted those signs of high breeding. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But they started asunder with beating hearts: something had fallen on the ground with a rattling noise; it was Hetty\u2019s basket; all her little workwoman\u2019s matters were scattered on the path, some of them showing a capability of rolling to great lengths. There was much to be done in picking up, and not a word was spoken; but when Arthur hung the basket over her arm again, the poor child felt a strange difference in his look and manner. He just pressed her hand, and said, with a look and tone that were almost chilling to her, \u201cI have been hindering you; I must not keep you any longer now. You will be expected at the house. Good-bye.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Without waiting for her to speak, he turned away from her and hurried back towards the road that led to the Hermitage, leaving Hetty to pursue her way in a strange dream that seemed to have begun in bewildering delight and was now passing into contrarieties and sadness. Would he meet her again as she came home? Why had he spoken almost as if he were displeased with her? And then run away so suddenly? She cried, hardly knowing why. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur too was very uneasy, but his feelings were lit up for him by a more distinct consciousness. He hurried to the Hermitage, which stood in the heart of the wood, unlocked the door with a hasty wrench, slammed it after him, pitched ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Zeluco")," into the most distant corner, and thrusting his right hand into his pocket, first walked four or five times up and down the scanty length of the little room, and then seated himself on the ottoman in an uncomfortable stiff way, as we often do when we wish not to abandon ourselves to feeling. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He was getting in love with Hetty\u2014that was quite plain. He was ready to pitch everything else\u2014no matter where\u2014for the sake of surrendering himself to this delicious feeling which had just disclosed itself. It was no use blinking the fact now\u2014they would get too fond of each other, if he went on taking notice of her\u2014and what would come of it? He should have to go away in a few weeks, and the poor little thing would be miserable. He ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"must not")," see her alone again; he must keep out of her way. What a fool he was for coming back from Gawaine\u2019s! "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He got up and threw open the windows, to let in the soft breath of the afternoon, and the healthy scent of the firs that made a belt round the Hermitage. The soft air did not help his resolution, as he leaned out and looked into the leafy distance. But he considered his resolution sufficiently fixed: there was no need to debate with himself any longer. He had made up his mind not to meet Hetty again; and now he might give himself up to thinking how immensely agreeable it would be if circumstances were different\u2014how pleasant it would have been to meet her this evening as she came back, and put his arm round her again and look into her sweet face. He wondered if the dear little thing were thinking of him too\u2014twenty to one she was. How beautiful her eyes were with the tear on their lashes! He would like to satisfy his soul for a day with looking at them, and he ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"must")," see her again\u2014he must see her, simply to remove any false impression from her mind about his manner to her just now. He would behave in a quiet, kind way to her\u2014just to prevent her from going home with her head full of wrong fancies. Yes, that would be the best thing to do after all. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It was a long while\u2014more than an hour before Arthur had brought his meditations to this point; but once arrived there, he could stay no longer at the Hermitage. The time must be filled up with movement until he should see Hetty again. And it was already late enough to go and dress for dinner, for his grandfather\u2019s dinner-hour was six."))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

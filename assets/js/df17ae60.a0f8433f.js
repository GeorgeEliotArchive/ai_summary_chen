Childhood has no forebodings; but then, it is soothed by no memories of outlived sorrow. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The fact was, the day had begun ill with Maggie. The pleasure of having Lucy to look at, and the prospect of the afternoon visit to Garum Firs, where she would hear uncle Pullet\u2019s musical box, had been marred as early as eleven o\u2019clock by the advent of the hair-dresser from St Ogg\u2019s, who had spoken in the severest terms of the condition in which he had found her hair, holding up one jagged lock after another and saying, \u201cSee here! tut, tut, tut!\u201d in a tone of mingled disgust and pity, which to Maggie\u2019s imagination was equivalent to the strongest expression of public opinion. Mr Rappit, the hair-dresser, with his well-anointed coronal locks tending wavily upward, like the simulated pyramid of flame on a monumental urn, seemed to her at that moment the most formidable of her contemporaries, into whose street at St Ogg\u2019s she would carefully refrain from entering through the rest of her life. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Moreover, the preparation for a visit being always a serious affair in the Dodson family, Martha was enjoined to have Mrs Tulliver\u2019s room ready an hour earlier than usual, that the laying out of the best clothes might not be deferred till the last moment, as was sometimes the case in families of lax views, where the ribbon-strings were never rolled up, where there was little or no wrapping in silver paper, and where the sense that the Sunday clothes could be got at quite easily produced no shock to the mind. Already, at twelve o\u2019clock, Mrs Tulliver had on her visiting costume, with a protective apparatus of brown holland, as if she had been a piece of satin furniture in danger of flies; Maggie was frowning and twisting her shoulders, that she might if possible shrink away from the prickliest of tuckers, while her mother was remonstrating, \u201cDon\u2019t, Maggie, my dear; don\u2019t make yourself so ugly!\u201d and Tom\u2019s cheeks were looking particularly brilliant as a relief to his best blue suit, which he wore with becoming calmness, having, after a little wrangling, effected what was always the one point of interest to him in his toilet: he had transferred all the contents of his everyday pockets to those actually in wear. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  As for Lucy, she was just as pretty and neat as she had been yesterday; no accidents ever happened to her clothes, and she was never uncomfortable in them, so that she looked with wondering pity at Maggie, pouting and writhing under the exasperating tucker. Maggie would certainly have torn it off, if she had not been checked by the remembrance of her recent humiliation about her hair; as it was, she confined herself to fretting and twisting, and behaving peevishly about the card-houses which they were allowed to build till dinner, as a suitable amusement for boys and girls in their best clothes. Tom could build perfect pyramids of houses; but Maggie\u2019s would never bear the laying on the roof. It was always so with the things that Maggie made; and Tom had deduced the conclusion that no girls could ever make anything. But it happened that Lucy proved wonderfully clever at building; she handled the cards so lightly, and moved so gently, that Tom condescended to admire her houses as well as his own, the more readily because she had asked him to teach her. Maggie, too, would have admired Lucy\u2019s houses, and would have given up her own unsuccessful building to contemplate them, without ill temper, if her tucker had not made her peevish, and if Tom had not inconsiderately laughed when her houses fell, and told her she was \u201ca stupid.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me, Tom!\u201d she burst out angrily; \u201cI\u2019m not a stupid.

I like Lucy better than you; ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I")," wish Lucy was ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"my")," sister.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThen it\u2019s very wicked and cruel of you to wish so,\u201d said Maggie, starting up hurriedly from her place on the floor, and upsetting Tom\u2019s wonderful pagoda. She really did not mean it, but the circumstantial evidence was against her, and Tom turned white with anger, but said nothing; he would have struck her, only he knew it was cowardly to strike a girl, and Tom Tulliver was quite determined he would never do anything cowardly. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie stood in dismay and terror, while Tom got up from the floor and walked away, pale, from the scattered ruins of his pagoda, and Lucy looked on mutely, like a kitten pausing from its lapping. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, Tom,\u201d said Maggie, at last, going half-way toward him, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to knock it down, indeed, indeed I didn\u2019t.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Tom took no notice of her, but took, instead, two or three hard peas out of his pocket, and shot them with his thumbnail against the window, vaguely at first, but presently with the distinct aim of hitting a superannuated blue-bottle which was exposing its imbecility in the spring sunshine, clearly against the views of Nature, who had provided Tom and the peas for the speedy destruction of this weak individual. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Thus the morning had been made heavy to Maggie, and Tom\u2019s persistent coldness to her all through their walk spoiled the fresh air and sunshine for her. He called Lucy to look at the half-built bird\u2019s nest without caring to show it Maggie, and peeled a willow switch for Lucy and himself, without offering one to Maggie. Lucy had said, \u201cMaggie, shouldn\u2019t ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you")," like one?\u201d but Tom was deaf. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Still, the sight of the peacock opportunely spreading his tail on the stackyard wall, just as they reached Garum Firs, was enough to divert the mind temporarily from personal grievances. And this was only the beginning of beautiful sights at Garum Firs. All the farmyard life was wonderful there,\u2014bantams, speckled and top-knotted; Friesland hens, with their feathers all turned the wrong way; Guinea-fowls that flew and screamed and dropped their pretty spotted feathers; pouter-pigeons and a tame magpie; nay, a goat, and a wonderful brindled dog, half mastiff, half bull-dog, as large as a lion. Then there were white railings and white gates all about, and glittering weathercocks of various design, and garden-walks paved with pebbles in beautiful patterns,\u2014nothing was quite common at Garum Firs; and Tom thought that the unusual size of the toads there was simply due to the general unusualness which characterised uncle Pullet\u2019s possessions as a gentleman farmer. Toads who paid rent were naturally leaner. As for the house, it was not less remarkable; it had a receding centre, and two wings with battlemented turrets, and was covered with glittering white stucco. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Uncle Pullet had seen the expected party approaching from the window, and made haste to unbar and unchain the front door, kept always in this fortified condition from fear of tramps, who might be supposed to know of the glass case of stuffed birds in the hall, and to contemplate rushing in and carrying it away on their heads. Aunt Pullet, too, appeared at the doorway, and as soon as her sister was within hearing said, \u201cStop the children, for God\u2019s sake! Bessy; don\u2019t let \u2019em come up the door-steps; Sally\u2019s bringing the old mat and the duster, to rub their shoes.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Pullet\u2019s front-door mats were by no means intended to wipe shoes on; the very scraper had a deputy to do its dirty work. Tom rebelled particularly against this shoewiping, which he always considered in the light of an indignity to his sex. He felt it as the beginning of the disagreeables incident to a visit at aunt Pullet\u2019s, where he had once been compelled to sit with towels wrapped round his boots; a fact which may serve to correct the too hasty conclusion that a visit to Garum Firs must have been a great treat to a young gentleman fond of animals,\u2014fond, that is, of throwing stones at them. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The next disagreeable was confined to his feminine companions; it was the mounting of the polished oak stairs, which had very handsome carpets rolled up and laid by in a spare bedroom, so that the ascent of these glossy steps might have served, in barbarous times, as a trial by ordeal from which none but the most spotless virtue could have come off with unbroken limbs. Sophy\u2019s weakness about these polished stairs was always a subject of bitter remonstrance on Mrs Glegg\u2019s part; but Mrs Tulliver ventured on no comment, only thinking to herself it was a mercy when she and the children were safe on the landing. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMrs Gray has sent home my new bonnet, Bessy,\u201d said Mrs Pullet, in a pathetic tone, as Mrs Tulliver adjusted her cap. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHas she, sister?\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, with an air of much interest. \u201cAnd how do you like it?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s apt to make a mess with clothes, taking \u2019em out and putting \u2019em in again,\u201d said Mrs Pullet, drawing a bunch of keys from her pocket and looking at them earnestly, \u201cbut it \u2019ud be a pity for you to go away without seeing it. There\u2019s no knowing what may happen.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Pullet shook her head slowly at this last serious consideration, which determined her to single out a particular key. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be troublesome to you getting it out, sister,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver; \u201cbut I ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"should")," like to see what sort of a crown she\u2019s made you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Pullet rose with a melancholy air and unlocked one wing of a very bright wardrobe, where you may have hastily supposed she would find a new bonnet. Not at all. Such a supposition could only have arisen from a too superficial acquaintance with the habits of the Dodson family. In this wardrobe Mrs Pullet was seeking something small enough to be hidden among layers of linen,\u2014it was a door-key. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou must come with me into the best room,\u201d said Mrs Pullet. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMay the children come too, sister?\u201d inquired Mrs Tulliver, who saw that Maggie and Lucy were looking rather eager. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d said aunt Pullet, reflectively, \u201cit\u2019ll perhaps be safer for \u2019em to come; they\u2019ll be touching something if we leave \u2019em behind.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  So they went in procession along the bright and slippery corridor, dimly lighted by the semi-lunar top of the window which rose above the closed shutter; it was really quite solemn. Aunt Pullet paused and unlocked a door which opened on something still more solemn than the passage,\u2014a darkened room, in which the outer light, entering feebly, showed what looked like the corpses of furniture in white shrouds. Everything that was not shrouded stood with its legs upward. Lucy laid hold of Maggie\u2019s frock, and Maggie\u2019s heart beat rapidly. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Aunt Pullet half-opened the shutter and then unlocked the wardrobe, with a melancholy deliberateness which was quite in keeping with the funereal solemnity of the scene. The delicious scent of rose-leaves that issued from the wardrobe made the process of taking out sheet after sheet of silver paper quite pleasant to assist at, though the sight of the bonnet at last was an anticlimax to Maggie, who would have preferred something more strikingly preternatural. But few things could have been more impressive to Mrs Tulliver. She looked all round it in silence for some moments, and then said emphatically, \u201cWell, sister, I\u2019ll never speak against the full crowns again!\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It was a great concession, and Mrs Pullet felt it; she felt something was due to it. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019d like to see it on, sister?\u201d she said sadly. \u201cI\u2019ll open the shutter a bit further.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t mind taking off your cap, sister,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Pullet took off her cap, displaying the brown silk scalp with a jutting promontory of curls which was common to the more mature and judicious women of those times, and placing the bonnet on her head, turned slowly round, like a draper\u2019s lay-figure, that Mrs Tulliver might miss no point of view. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ve sometimes thought there\u2019s a loop too much o\u2019 ribbon on this left side, sister; what do you think?\u201d said Mrs Pullet. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver looked earnestly at the point indicated, and turned her head on one side. \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s best as it is; if you meddled with it, sister, you might repent.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said aunt Pullet, taking off the bonnet and looking at it contemplatively. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHow much might she charge you for that bonnet, sister?\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, whose mind was actively engaged on the possibility of getting a humble imitation of this ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre")," made from a piece of silk she had at home. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Pullet screwed up her mouth and shook her head, and then whispered, \u201cPullet pays for it; he said I was to have the best bonnet at Garum Church, let the next best be whose it would.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  She began slowly to adjust the trimmings, in preparation for returning it to its place in the wardrobe, and her thoughts seemed to have taken a melancholy turn, for she shook her head. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh,\u201d she said at last, \u201cI may never wear it twice, sister; who knows?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t talk o\u2019 that sister,\u201d answered Mrs Tulliver. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll have your health this summer.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh! but there may come a death in the family, as there did soon after I had my green satin bonnet. Cousin Abbott may go, and we can\u2019t think o\u2019 wearing crape less nor half a year for him.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"would")," be unlucky,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, entering thoroughly into the possibility of an inopportune decease. \u201cThere\u2019s never so much pleasure i\u2019 wearing a bonnet the second year, especially when the crowns are so chancy,\u2014never two summers alike.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, it\u2019s the way i\u2019 this world,\u201d said Mrs Pullet, returning the bonnet to the wardrobe and locking it up. She maintained a silence characterised by head-shaking, until they had all issued from the solemn chamber and were in her own room again. Then, beginning to cry, she said, \u201cSister, if you should never see that bonnet again till I\u2019m dead and gone, you\u2019ll remember I showed it you this day.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver felt that she ought to be affected, but she was a woman of sparse tears, stout and healthy; she couldn\u2019t cry so much as her sister Pullet did, and had often felt her deficiency at funerals. Her effort to bring tears into her eyes issued in an odd contraction of her face. Maggie, looking on attentively, felt that there was some painful mystery about her aunt\u2019s bonnet which she was considered too young to understand; indignantly conscious, all the while, that she could have understood that, as well as everything else, if she had been taken into confidence. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  When they went down, uncle Pullet observed, with some acumen, that he reckoned the missis had been showing her bonnet,\u2014that was what had made them so long upstairs. With Tom the interval had seemed still longer, for he had been seated in irksome constraint on the edge of a sofa directly opposite his uncle Pullet, who regarded him with twinkling gray eyes, and occasionally addressed him as \u201cYoung sir.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, young sir, what do you learn at school?\u201d was a standing question with uncle Pullet; whereupon Tom always looked sheepish, rubbed his hands across his face, and answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d It was altogether so embarrassing to be seated ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate")," with uncle Pullet, that Tom could not even look at the prints on the walls, or the flycages, or the wonderful flower-pots; he saw nothing but his uncle\u2019s gaiters. Not that Tom was in awe of his uncle\u2019s mental superiority; indeed, he had made up his mind that he didn\u2019t want to be a gentleman farmer, because he shouldn\u2019t like to be such a thin-legged, silly fellow as his uncle Pullet,\u2014a molly-coddle, in fact. A boy\u2019s sheepishness is by no means a sign of overmastering reverence; and while you are making encouraging advances to him under the idea that he is overwhelmed by a sense of your age and wisdom, ten to one he is thinking you extremely queer. The only consolation I can suggest to you is, that the Greek boys probably thought the same of Aristotle. It is only when you have mastered a restive horse, or thrashed a drayman, or have got a gun in your hand, that these shy juniors feel you to be a truly admirable and enviable character. At least, I am quite sure of Tom Tulliver\u2019s sentiments on these points. In very tender years, when he still wore a lace border under his outdoor cap, he was often observed peeping through the bars of a gate and making minatory gestures with his small forefinger while he scolded the sheep with an inarticulate burr, intended to strike terror into their astonished minds; indicating thus early that desire for mastery over the inferior animals, wild and domestic, including cockchafers, neighbours\u2019 dogs, and small sisters, which in all ages has been an attribute of so much promise for the fortunes of our race. Now, Mr Pullet never rode anything taller than a low pony, and was the least predatory of men, considering firearms dangerous, as apt to go off of themselves by nobody\u2019s particular desire. So that Tom was not without strong reasons when, in confidential talk with a chum, he had described uncle Pullet as a nincompoop, taking care at the same time to observe that he was a very \u201crich fellow.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The only alleviating circumstance in a ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate")," with uncle Pullet was that he kept a variety of lozenges and peppermint-drops about his person, and when at a loss for conversation, he filled up the void by proposing a mutual solace of this kind. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDo you like peppermints, young sir?\u201d required only a tacit answer when it was accompanied by a presentation of the article in question. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The appearance of the little girls suggested to uncle Pullet the further solace of small sweet-cakes, of which he also kept a stock under lock and key for his own private eating on wet days; but the three children had no sooner got the tempting delicacy between their fingers, than aunt Pullet desired them to abstain from eating it till the tray and the plates came, since with those crisp cakes they would make the floor \u201call over\u201d crumbs. Lucy didn\u2019t mind that much, for the cake was so pretty, she thought it was rather a pity to eat it; but Tom, watching his opportunity while the elders were talking, hastily stowed it in his mouth at two bites, and chewed it furtively. As for Maggie, becoming fascinated, as usual, by a print of Ulysses and Nausicaa, which uncle Pullet had bought as a \u201cpretty Scripture thing,\u201d she presently let fall her cake, and in an unlucky movement crushed it beneath her foot,\u2014a source of so much agitation to aunt Pullet and conscious disgrace to Maggie, that she began to despair of hearing the musical snuff-box to-day, till, after some reflection, it occurred to her that Lucy was in high favour enough to venture on asking for a tune. So she whispered to Lucy; and Lucy, who always did what she was desired to do, went up quietly to her uncle\u2019s knee, and blushing all over her neck while she fingered her necklace, said, \u201cWill you please play us a tune, uncle?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Lucy thought it was by reason of some exceptional talent in uncle Pullet that the snuff-box played such beautiful tunes, and indeed the thing was viewed in that light by the majority of his neighbours in Garum. Mr Pullet had ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"bought")," the box, to begin with, and he understood winding it up, and knew which tune it was going to play beforehand; altogether the possession of this unique \u201cpiece of music\u201d was a proof that Mr Pullet\u2019s character was not of that entire nullity which might otherwise have been attributed to it. But uncle Pullet, when entreated to exhibit his accomplishment, never depreciated it by a too ready consent. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about it,\u201d was the answer he always gave, carefully abstaining from any sign of compliance till a suitable number of minutes had passed. Uncle Pullet had a programme for all great social occasions, and in this way fenced himself in from much painful confusion and perplexing freedom of will. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Perhaps the suspense did heighten Maggie\u2019s enjoyment when the fairy tune began; for the first time she quite forgot that she had a load on her mind, that Tom was angry with her; and by the time \u201cHush, ye pretty warbling choir,\u201d had been played, her face wore that bright look of happiness, while she sat immovable with her hands clasped, which sometimes comforted her mother with the sense that Maggie could look pretty now and then, in spite of her brown skin. But when the magic music ceased, she jumped up, and running toward Tom, put her arm round his neck and said, \u201cOh, Tom, isn\u2019t it pretty?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Lest you should think it showed a revolting insensibility in Tom that he felt any new anger toward Maggie for this uncalled-for and, to him, inexplicable caress, I must tell you that he had his glass of cowslip wine in his hand, and that she jerked him so as to make him spill half of it. He must have been an extreme milksop not to say angrily, \u201cLook there, now!\u201d especially when his resentment was sanctioned, as it was, by general disapprobation of Maggie\u2019s behaviour. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit still, Maggie?\u201d her mother said peevishly. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLittle gells mustn\u2019t come to see me if they behave in that way,\u201d said aunt Pullet. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, you\u2019re too rough, little miss,\u201d said uncle Pullet. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Poor Maggie sat down again, with the music all chased out of her soul, and the seven small demons all in again. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver, foreseeing nothing but misbehaviour while the children remained indoors, took an early opportunity of suggesting that, now they were rested after their walk, they might go and play out of doors; and aunt Pullet gave permission, only enjoining them not to go off the paved walks in the garden, and if they wanted to see the poultry fed, to view them from a distance on the horse-block; a restriction which had been imposed ever since Tom had been found guilty of running after the peacock, with an illusory idea that fright would make one of its feathers drop off. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver\u2019s thoughts had been temporarily diverted from the quarrel with Mrs Glegg by millinery and maternal cares, but now the great theme of the bonnet was thrown into perspective, and the children were out of the way, yesterday\u2019s anxieties recurred. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt weighs on my mind so as never was,\u201d she said, by way of opening the subject, \u201csister Glegg\u2019s leaving the house in that way. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d no wish t\u2019 offend a sister.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh,\u201d said aunt Pullet, \u201cthere\u2019s no accounting for what Jane \u2019ull do. I wouldn\u2019t speak of it out o\u2019 the family, if it wasn\u2019t to Dr Turnbull; but it\u2019s my belief Jane lives too low. I\u2019ve said so to Pullet often and often, and he knows it.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, you said so last Monday was a week, when we came away from drinking tea with \u2019em,\u201d said Mr Pullet, beginning to nurse his knee and shelter it with his pocket handkerchief, as was his way when the conversation took an interesting turn. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cVery like I did,\u201d said Mrs Pullet, \u201cfor you remember when I said things, better than I can remember myself. He\u2019s got a wonderful memory, Pullet has,\u201d she continued, looking pathetically at her sister. \u201cI should be poorly off if he was to have a stroke, for he always remembers when I\u2019ve got to take my doctor\u2019s stuff; and I\u2019m taking three sorts now.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere\u2019s the \u2018pills as before\u2019 every other night, and the new drops at eleven and four, and the \u2019fervescing mixture \u2018when agreeable,\u2019\u201d rehearsed Mr Pullet, with a punctuation determined by a lozenge on his tongue. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, perhaps it \u2019ud be better for sister Glegg if ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"she\u2019d")," go to the doctor sometimes, instead o\u2019 chewing Turkey rhubarb whenever there\u2019s anything the matter with her,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, who naturally saw the wide subject of medicine chiefly in relation to Mrs Glegg. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s dreadful to think on,\u201d said aunt Pullet, raising her hands and letting them fall again, \u201cpeople playing with their own insides in that way! And it\u2019s flying i\u2019 the face o\u2019 Providence; for what are the doctors for, if we aren\u2019t to call \u2019em in? And when folks have got the money to pay for a doctor, it isn\u2019t respectable, as I\u2019ve told Jane many a time. I\u2019m ashamed of acquaintance knowing it.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"we\u2019ve")," no call to be ashamed,\u201d said Mr Pullet, \u201cfor Doctor Turnbull hasn\u2019t got such another patient as you i\u2019 this parish, now old Mrs Sutton\u2019s gone.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cPullet keeps all my physic-bottles, did you know, Bessy?\u201d said Mrs Pullet. \u201cHe won\u2019t have one sold. He says it\u2019s nothing but right folks should see \u2019em when I\u2019m gone. They fill two o\u2019 the long store-room shelves a\u2019ready; but,\u201d she added, beginning to cry a little, \u201cit\u2019s well if they ever fill three. I may go before I\u2019ve made up the dozen o\u2019 these last sizes. The pill-boxes are in the closet in my room,\u2014you\u2019ll remember that, sister,\u2014but there\u2019s nothing to show for the boluses, if it isn\u2019t the bills.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t talk o\u2019 your going, sister,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver; \u201cI should have nobody to stand between me and sister Glegg if you was gone. And there\u2019s nobody but you can get her to make it up with Mr Tulliver, for sister Deane\u2019s never o\u2019 my side, and if she was, it\u2019s not to be looked for as she can speak like them as have got an independent fortin.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, your husband ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"is")," awk\u2019ard, you know, Bessy,\u201d said Mrs Pullet, good-naturedly ready to use her deep depression on her sister\u2019s account as well as her own. \u201cHe\u2019s never behaved quite so pretty to our family as he should do, and the children take after him,\u2014the boy\u2019s very mischievous, and runs away from his aunts and uncles, and the gell\u2019s rude and brown. It\u2019s your bad luck, and I\u2019m sorry for you, Bessy; for you was allays my favourite sister, and we allays liked the same patterns.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI know Tulliver\u2019s hasty, and says odd things,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, wiping away one small tear from the corner of her eye; \u201cbut I\u2019m sure he\u2019s never been the man, since he married me, to object to my making the friends o\u2019 my side o\u2019 the family welcome to the house.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201c",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I")," don\u2019t want to make the worst of you, Bessy,\u201d said Mrs Pullet, compassionately, \u201cfor I doubt you\u2019ll have trouble enough without that; and your husband\u2019s got that poor sister and her children hanging on him,\u2014and so given to lawing, they say. I doubt he\u2019ll leave you poorly off when he dies. Not as I\u2019d have it said out o\u2019 the family.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  This view of her position was naturally far from cheering to Mrs Tulliver. Her imagination was not easily acted on, but she could not help thinking that her case was a hard one, since it appeared that other people thought it hard. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m sure, sister, I can\u2019t help myself,\u201d she said, urged by the fear lest her anticipated misfortunes might be held retributive, to take comprehensive review of her past conduct. \u201cThere\u2019s no woman strives more for her children; and I\u2019m sure at scouring-time this Lady-day as I\u2019ve had all the bedhangings taken down I did as much as the two gells put together; and there\u2019s the last elder-flower wine I\u2019ve made\u2014beautiful! I allays offer it along with the sherry, though sister Glegg will have it I\u2019m so extravagant; and as for liking to have my clothes tidy, and not go a fright about the house, there\u2019s nobody in the parish can say anything against me in respect o\u2019 backbiting and making mischief, for I don\u2019t wish anybody any harm; and nobody loses by sending me a porkpie, for my pies are fit to show with the best o\u2019 my neighbours\u2019; and the linen\u2019s so in order as if I was to die to-morrow I shouldn\u2019t be ashamed.

Not but what if you was sold up, and other folks bought your furniture, it\u2019s a comfort to think as you\u2019ve kept it well rubbed. And there\u2019s the linen, with your maiden mark on, might go all over the country. It \u2019ud be a sad pity for our family.\u201d Mrs Pullet shook her head slowly. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut what can I do, sister?\u201d said Mrs Tulliver. \u201cMr Tulliver\u2019s not a man to be dictated to,\u2014not if I was to go to the parson and get by heart what I should tell my husband for the best. And I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t pretend to know anything about putting out money and all that.

But Jane and me were allays contrairy; she ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"would")," have striped things, and I like spots. You like a spot too, Bessy; we allays hung together i\u2019 that.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, Sophy,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, \u201cI remember our having a blue ground with a white spot both alike,\u2014I\u2019ve got a bit in a bed-quilt now; and if you would but go and see sister Glegg, and persuade her to make it up with Tulliver, I should take it very kind of you. You was allays a good sister to me.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut the right thing \u2019ud be for Tulliver to go and make it up with her himself, and say he was sorry for speaking so rash. If he\u2019s borrowed money of her, he shouldn\u2019t be above that,\u201d said Mrs Pullet, whose partiality did not blind her to principles; she did not forget what was due to people of independent fortune. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s no use talking o\u2019 that,\u201d said poor Mrs Tulliver, almost peevishly. \u201cIf I was to go down on my bare knees on the gravel to Tulliver, he\u2019d never humble himself.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, you can\u2019t expect me to persuade ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Jane")," to beg pardon,\u201d said Mrs Pullet. \u201cHer temper\u2019s beyond everything; it\u2019s well if it doesn\u2019t carry her off her mind, though there never ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"was")," any of our family went to a madhouse.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m not thinking of her begging pardon,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver. \u201cBut if she\u2019d just take no notice, and not call her money in; as it\u2019s not so much for one sister to ask of another; time \u2019ud mend things, and Tulliver \u2019ud forget all about it, and they\u2019d be friends again.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver, you perceive, was not aware of her husband\u2019s irrevocable determination to pay in the five hundred pounds; at least such a determination exceeded her powers of belief.

The door did, in fact, soon open, but instead of the tea-tray, Sally introduced an object so startling that both Mrs Pullet and Mrs Tulliver gave a scream, causing uncle Pullet to swallow his lozenge\u2014for the fifth time in his life, as he afterward noted."))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

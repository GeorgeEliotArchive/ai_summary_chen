If he had not carried in his pocket a parcel of sugar-candy and a small Dutch doll for little Laura, there would have been no ray of expected pleasure to enliven the general gloom. But he liked to think how Laura would put out her lips and her tiny hands for the bits of sugarcandy; and to give the greater keenness to these pleasures of imagination, he took out the parcel, made a small hole in the paper, and bit off a crystal or two, which had so solacing an effect under the confined prospect and damp odors of the gig-umbrella, that he repeated the process more than once on his way. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, Tulliver, we\u2019re glad to see you again,\u201d said Mr Stelling, heartily. \u201cTake off your wrappings and come into the study till dinner.

He had seen Philip Wakem at St Ogg\u2019s, but had always turned his eyes away from him as quickly as possible. He would have disliked having a deformed boy for his companion, even if Philip had not been the son of a bad man. And Tom did not see how a bad man\u2019s son could be very good. His own father was a good man, and he would readily have fought any one who said the contrary. He was in a state of mingled embarrassment and defiance as he followed Mr Stelling to the study. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHere is a new companion for you to shake hands with, Tulliver,\u201d said that gentleman on entering the study,\u2014\u201cMaster Philip Wakem. I shall leave you to make acquaintance by yourselves. You already know something of each other, I imagine; for you are neighbours at home.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom looked confused and awkward, while Philip rose and glanced at him timidly.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Stelling wisely turned away, and closed the door behind him; boys\u2019 shyness only wears off in the absence of their elders. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Philip was at once too proud and too timid to walk toward Tom. He thought, or rather felt, that Tom had an aversion to looking at him; every one, almost, disliked looking at him; and his deformity was more conspicuous when he walked. So they remained without shaking hands or even speaking, while Tom went to the fire and warmed himself, every now and then casting furtive glances at Philip, who seemed to be drawing absently first one object and then another on a piece of paper he had before him. He had seated himself again, and as he drew, was thinking what he could say to Tom, and trying to overcome his own repugnance to making the first advances. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom began to look oftener and longer at Philip\u2019s face, for he could see it without noticing the hump, and it was really not a disagreeable face,\u2014very old-looking, Tom thought. He wondered how much older Philip was than himself. An anatomist\u2014even a mere physiognomist\u2014would have seen that the deformity of Philip\u2019s spine was not a congenital hump, but the result of an accident in infancy; but you do not expect from Tom any acquaintance with such distinctions; to him, Philip was simply a humpback. He had a vague notion that the deformity of Wakem\u2019s son had some relation to the lawyer\u2019s rascality, of which he had so often heard his father talk with hot emphasis; and he felt, too, a half-admitted fear of him as probably a spiteful fellow, who, not being able to fight you, had cunning ways of doing you a mischief by the sly. There was a humpbacked tailor in the neighbourhood of Mr Jacobs\u2019s academy, who was considered a very unamiable character, and was much hooted after by public-spirited boys solely on the ground of his unsatisfactory moral qualities; so that Tom was not without a basis of fact to go upon. Still, no face could be more unlike that ugly tailor\u2019s than this melancholy boy\u2019s face,\u2014the brown hair round it waved and curled at the ends like a girl\u2019s: Tom thought that truly pitiable. This Wakem was a pale, puny fellow, and it was quite clear he would not be able to play at anything worth speaking of; but he handled his pencil in an enviable manner, and was apparently making one thing after another without any trouble. What was he drawing? Tom was quite warm now, and wanted something new to be going forward. It was certainly more agreeable to have an ill-natured humpback as a companion than to stand looking out of the study window at the rain, and kicking his foot against the washboard in solitude; something would happen every day,\u2014\u201ca quarrel or something\u201d; and Tom thought he should rather like to show Philip that he had better not try his spiteful tricks on ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"him"),". He suddenly walked across the hearth and looked over Philip\u2019s paper. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, that\u2019s a donkey with panniers, and a spaniel, and partridges in the corn!\u201d he exclaimed, his tongue being completely loosed by surprise and admiration. \u201cOh my buttons! I wish I could draw like that. I\u2019m to learn drawing this half; I wonder if I shall learn to make dogs and donkeys!\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, you can do them without learning,\u201d said Philip; \u201cI never learned drawing.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNever learned?\u201d said Tom, in amazement. \u201cWhy, when I make dogs and horses, and those things, the heads and the legs won\u2019t come right; though I can see how they ought to be very well. I can make houses, and all sorts of chimneys,\u2014chimneys going all down the wall,\u2014and windows in the roof, and all that. But I dare say I could do dogs and horses if I was to try more,\u201d he added, reflecting that Philip might falsely suppose that he was going to \u201cknock under,\u201d if he were too frank about the imperfection of his accomplishments. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Philip, \u201cit\u2019s very easy. You\u2019ve only to look well at things, and draw them over and over again.

I should like to have been a Greek and fought the Persians, and then have come home and have written tragedies, or else have been listened to by everybody for my wisdom, like Socrates, and have died a grand death.\u201d (Philip, you perceive, was not without a wish to impress the well-made barbarian with a sense of his mental superiority.) "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, were the Greeks great fighters?\u201d said Tom, who saw a vista in this direction. \u201cIs there anything like David and Goliath and Samson in the Greek history?

And in the Odyssey\u2014that\u2019s a beautiful poem\u2014there\u2019s a more wonderful giant than Goliath,\u2014Polypheme, who had only one eye in the middle of his forehead; and Ulysses, a little fellow, but very wise and cunning, got a red-hot pine-tree and stuck it into this one eye, and made him roar like a thousand bulls.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, what fun!\u201d said Tom, jumping away from the table, and stamping first with one leg and then the other. \u201cI say, can you tell me all about those stories?

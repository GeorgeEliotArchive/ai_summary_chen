But one gets only a confused notion of these details when they surround a distractingly pretty girl of seventeen, standing on little pattens and rounding her dimpled arm to lift a pound of butter out of the scale. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty blushed a deep rose-colour when Captain Donnithorne entered the dairy and spoke to her; but it was not at all a distressed blush, for it was inwreathed with smiles and dimples, and with sparkles from under long, curled, dark eyelashes; and while her aunt was discoursing to him about the limited amount of milk that was to be spared for butter and cheese so long as the calves were not all weaned, and a large quantity but inferior quality of milk yielded by the shorthorn, which had been bought on experiment, together with other matters which must be interesting to a young gentleman who would one day be a landlord, Hetty tossed and patted her pound of butter with quite a self-possessed, coquettish air, slyly conscious that no turn of her head was lost. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  There are various orders of beauty, causing men to make fools of themselves in various styles, from the desperate to the sheepish; but there is one order of beauty which seems made to turn the heads not only of men, but of all intelligent mammals, even of women. It is a beauty like that of kittens, or very small downy ducks making gentle rippling noises with their soft bills, or babies just beginning to toddle and to engage in conscious mischief\u2014a beauty with which you can never be angry, but that you feel ready to crush for inability to comprehend the state of mind into which it throws you. Hetty Sorrel\u2019s was that sort of beauty. Her aunt, Mrs. Poyser, who professed to despise all personal attractions and intended to be the severest of mentors, continually gazed at Hetty\u2019s charms by the sly, fascinated in spite of herself; and after administering such a scolding as naturally flowed from her anxiety to do well by her husband\u2019s niece\u2014who had no mother of her own to scold her, poor thing!\u2014she would often confess to her husband, when they were safe out of hearing, that she firmly believed, \u201cthe naughtier the little huzzy behaved, the prettier she looked.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It is of little use for me to tell you that Hetty\u2019s cheek was like a rose-petal, that dimples played about her pouting lips, that her large dark eyes hid a soft roguishness under their long lashes, and that her curly hair, though all pushed back under her round cap while she was at work, stole back in dark delicate rings on her forehead, and about her white shell-like ears; it is of little use for me to say how lovely was the contour of her pink-and-white neckerchief, tucked into her low plum-coloured stuff bodice, or how the linen butter-making apron, with its bib, seemed a thing to be imitated in silk by duchesses, since it fell in such charming lines, or how her brown stockings and thick-soled buckled shoes lost all that clumsiness which they must certainly have had when empty of her foot and ankle\u2014of little use, unless you have seen a woman who affected you as Hetty affected her beholders, for otherwise, though you might conjure up the image of a lovely woman, she would not in the least resemble that distracting kittenlike maiden. I might mention all the divine charms of a bright spring day, but if you had never in your life utterly forgotten yourself in straining your eyes after the mounting lark, or in wandering through the still lanes when the fresh-opened blossoms fill them with a sacred silent beauty like that of fretted aisles, where would be the use of my descriptive catalogue? I could never make you know what I meant by a bright spring day. Hetty\u2019s was a spring-tide beauty; it was the beauty of young frisking things, round-limbed, gambolling, circumventing you by a false air of innocence\u2014the innocence of a young star-browed calf, for example, that, being inclined for a promenade out of bounds, leads you a severe steeplechase over hedge and ditch, and only comes to a stand in the middle of a bog. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  And they are the prettiest attitudes and movements into which a pretty girl is thrown in making up butter\u2014tossing movements that give a charming curve to the arm, and a sideward inclination of the round white neck; little patting and rolling movements with the palm of the hand, and nice adaptations and finishings which cannot at all be effected without a great play of the pouting mouth and the dark eyes. And then the butter itself seems to communicate a fresh charm\u2014it is so pure, so sweet-scented; it is turned off the mould with such a beautiful firm surface, like marble in a pale yellow light! Moreover, Hetty was particularly clever at making up the butter; it was the one performance of hers that her aunt allowed to pass without severe criticism; so she handled it with all the grace that belongs to mastery. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI hope you will be ready for a great holiday on the thirtieth of July, Mrs. Poyser,\u201d said Captain Donnithorne, when he had sufficiently admired the dairy and given several improvised opinions on Swede turnips and shorthorns. \u201cYou know what is to happen then, and I shall expect you to be one of the guests who come earliest and leave latest. Will you promise me your hand for two dances, Miss Hetty? If I don\u2019t get your promise now, I know I shall hardly have a chance, for all the smart young farmers will take care to secure you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty smiled and blushed, but before she could answer, Mrs. Poyser interposed, scandalized at the mere suggestion that the young squire could be excluded by any meaner partners. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIndeed, sir, you are very kind to take that notice of her. And I\u2019m sure, whenever you\u2019re pleased to dance with her, she\u2019ll be proud and thankful, if she stood still all the rest o\u2019 th\u2019 evening.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh no, no, that would be too cruel to all the other young fellows who can dance. But you will promise me two dances, won\u2019t you?\u201d the captain continued, determined to make Hetty look at him and speak to him. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty dropped the prettiest little curtsy, and stole a half-shy, half-coquettish glance at him as she said, \u201cYes, thank you, sir.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd you must bring all your children, you know, Mrs. Poyser; your little Totty, as well as the boys.

The captain was thought to be \u201cvery full of his jokes,\u201d and was a great favourite throughout the estate on account of his free manners. Every tenant was quite sure things would be different when the reins got into his hands\u2014there was to be a millennial abundance of new gates, allowances of lime, and returns of ten per cent.

She went into the brewhouse to Nancy, I think.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The proud mother, unable to resist the temptation to show her Totty, passed at once into the back kitchen, in search of her, not, however, without misgivings lest something should have happened to render her person and attire unfit for presentation. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd do you carry the butter to market when you\u2019ve made it?\u201d said the Captain to Hetty, meanwhile. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh no, sir; not when it\u2019s so heavy. I\u2019m not strong enough to carry it.

But you go out a walk sometimes these pleasant evenings, don\u2019t you? Why don\u2019t you have a walk in the Chase sometimes, now it\u2019s so green and pleasant?

But now she appeared holding her mother\u2019s hand\u2014the end of her round nose rather shiny from a recent and hurried application of soap and water. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHere she is!\u201d said the captain, lifting her up and setting her on the low stone shelf. \u201cHere\u2019s Totty! By the by, what\u2019s her other name? She wasn\u2019t christened Totty.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, sir, we call her sadly out of her name. Charlotte\u2019s her christened name. It\u2019s a name i\u2019 Mr. Poyser\u2019s family: his grandmother was named Charlotte. But we began with calling her Lotty, and now it\u2019s got to Totty. To be sure it\u2019s more like a name for a dog than a Christian child.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTotty\u2019s a capital name. Why, she looks like a Totty. Has she got a pocket on?\u201d said the captain, feeling in his own waistcoat pockets.

I declare I\u2019ve got five little round silver things, and hear what a pretty noise they make in Totty\u2019s pink pocket.\u201d Here he shook the pocket with the five sixpences in it, and Totty showed her teeth and wrinkled her nose in great glee; but, divining that there was nothing more to be got by staying, she jumped off the shelf and ran away to jingle her pocket in the hearing of Nancy, while her mother called after her, \u201cOh for shame, you naughty gell! Not to thank the captain for what he\u2019s given you I\u2019m sure, sir, it\u2019s very kind of you; but she\u2019s spoiled shameful; her father won\u2019t have her said nay in anything, and there\u2019s no managing her.

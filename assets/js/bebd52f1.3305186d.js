Oh that the good seed might fall on that soil, for it would surely flourish.\u201d The agreeable impression must have been mutual, for Mr. Irwine bowed to her with a benignant deference, which would have been equally in place if she had been the most dignified lady of his acquaintance.

Mrs. Fletcher, as you may have heard about, was the first woman to preach in the Society, I believe, before she was married, when she was Miss Bosanquet; and Mr. Wesley approved of her undertaking the work. She had a great gift, and there are many others now living who are precious fellow-helpers in the work of the ministry. I understand there\u2019s been voices raised against it in the Society of late, but I cannot but think their counsel will come to nought. It isn\u2019t for men to make channels for God\u2019s Spirit, as they make channels for the watercourses, and say, \u2018Flow here, but flow not there.\u2019\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut don\u2019t you find some danger among your people\u2014I don\u2019t mean to say that it is so with you, far from it\u2014but don\u2019t you find sometimes that both men and women fancy themselves channels for God\u2019s Spirit, and are quite mistaken, so that they set about a work for which they are unfit and bring holy things into contempt?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDoubtless it is so sometimes; for there have been evil-doers among us who have sought to deceive the brethren, and some there are who deceive their own selves. But we are not without discipline and correction to put a check upon these things. There\u2019s a very strict order kept among us, and the brethren and sisters watch for each other\u2019s souls as they that must give account.

But I had felt no call to preach, for when I\u2019m not greatly wrought upon, I\u2019m too much given to sit still and keep by myself. It seems as if I could sit silent all day long with the thought of God overflowing my soul\u2014as the pebbles lie bathed in the Willow Brook. For thoughts are so great\u2014aren\u2019t they, sir? They seem to lie upon us like a deep flood; and it\u2019s my besetment to forget where I am and everything about me, and lose myself in thoughts that I could give no account of, for I could neither make a beginning nor ending of them in words. That was my way as long as I can remember; but sometimes it seemed as if speech came to me without any will of my own, and words were given to me that came out as the tears come, because our hearts are full and we can\u2019t help it. And those were always times of great blessing, though I had never thought it could be so with me before a congregation of people. But, sir, we are led on, like the little children, by a way that we know not. I was called to preach quite suddenly, and since then I have never been left in doubt about the work that was laid upon me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut tell me the circumstances\u2014just how it was, the very day you began to preach.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt was one Sunday I walked with brother Marlowe, who was an aged man, one of the local preachers, all the way to Hetton-Deeps\u2014that\u2019s a village where the people get their living by working in the lead-mines, and where there\u2019s no church nor preacher, but they live like sheep without a shepherd. It\u2019s better than twelve miles from Snowfield, so we set out early in the morning, for it was summertime; and I had a wonderful sense of the Divine love as we walked over the hills, where there\u2019s no trees, you know, sir, as there is here, to make the sky look smaller, but you see the heavens stretched out like a tent, and you feel the everlasting arms around you. But before we got to Hetton, brother Marlowe was seized with a dizziness that made him afraid of falling, for he overworked himself sadly, at his years, in watching and praying, and walking so many miles to speak the Word, as well as carrying on his trade of linen-weaving. And when we got to the village, the people were expecting him, for he\u2019d appointed the time and the place when he was there before, and such of them as cared to hear the Word of Life were assembled on a spot where the cottages was thickest, so as others might be drawn to come. But he felt as he couldn\u2019t stand up to preach, and he was forced to lie down in the first of the cottages we came to. So I went to tell the people, thinking we\u2019d go into one of the houses, and I would read and pray with them. But as I passed along by the cottages and saw the aged and trembling women at the doors, and the hard looks of the men, who seemed to have their eyes no more filled with the sight of the Sabbath morning than if they had been dumb oxen that never looked up to the sky, I felt a great movement in my soul, and I trembled as if I was shaken by a strong spirit entering into my weak body. And I went to where the little flock of people was gathered together, and stepped on the low wall that was built against the green hillside, and I spoke the words that were given to me abundantly. And they all came round me out of all the cottages, and many wept over their sins, and have since been joined to the Lord. That was the beginning of my preaching, sir, and I\u2019ve preached ever since.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Dinah had let her work fall during this narrative, which she uttered in her usual simple way, but with that sincere articulate, thrilling treble by which she always mastered her audience. She stooped now to gather up her sewing, and then went on with it as before. Mr. Irwine was deeply interested. He said to himself, \u201cHe must be a miserable prig who would act the pedagogue here: one might as well go and lecture the trees for growing in their own shape.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd you never feel any embarrassment from the sense of your youth\u2014that you are a lovely young woman on whom men\u2019s eyes are fixed?\u201d he said aloud. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, I\u2019ve no room for such feelings, and I don\u2019t believe the people ever take notice about that. I think, sir, when God makes His presence felt through us, we are like the burning bush: Moses never took any heed what sort of bush it was\u2014he only saw the brightness of the Lord. I\u2019ve preached to as rough ignorant people as can be in the villages about Snowfield\u2014men that looked very hard and wild\u2014but they never said an uncivil word to me, and often thanked me kindly as they made way for me to pass through the midst of them.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201c",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"That")," I can believe\u2014that I can well believe,\u201d said Mr. Irwine, emphatically. \u201cAnd what did you think of your hearers last night, now? Did you find them quiet and attentive?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cVery quiet, sir, but I saw no signs of any great work upon them, except in a young girl named Bessy Cranage, towards whom my heart yearned greatly, when my eyes first fell on her blooming youth, given up to folly and vanity. I had some private talk and prayer with her afterwards, and I trust her heart is touched. But I\u2019ve noticed that in these villages where the people lead a quiet life among the green pastures and the still waters, tilling the ground and tending the cattle, there\u2019s a strange deadness to the Word, as different as can be from the great towns, like Leeds, where I once went to visit a holy woman who preaches there. It\u2019s wonderful how rich is the harvest of souls up those high-walled streets, where you seemed to walk as in a prison-yard, and the ear is deafened with the sounds of worldly toil. I think maybe it is because the promise is sweeter when this life is so dark and weary, and the soul gets more hungry when the body is ill at ease.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, yes, our farm-labourers are not easily roused. They take life almost as slowly as the sheep and cows. But we have some intelligent workmen about here. I daresay you know the Bedes; Seth Bede, by the by, is a Methodist.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, I know Seth well, and his brother Adam a little. Seth is a gracious young man\u2014sincere and without offence; and Adam is like the patriarch Joseph, for his great skill and knowledge and the kindness he shows to his brother and his parents.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t know the trouble that has just happened to them?

Mr. Irwine now rose also, and, advancing towards Dinah, held out his hand, and said, \u201cGood-bye. I hear you are going away soon; but this will not be the last visit you will pay your aunt\u2014so we shall meet again, I hope.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  His cordiality towards Dinah set all Mrs. Poyser\u2019s anxieties at rest, and her face was brighter than usual, as she said, \u201cI\u2019ve never asked after Mrs. Irwine and the Miss Irwines, sir; I hope they\u2019re as well as usual.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, thank you, Mrs. Poyser, except that Miss Anne has one of her bad headaches to-day.

Mrs. Poyser delighted in this noisy exit; it was a fresh assurance to her that the farm-yard was well guarded, and that no loiterers could enter unobserved; and it was not until the gate had closed behind the captain that she turned into the kitchen again, where Dinah stood with her bonnet in her hand, waiting to speak to her aunt, before she set out for Lisbeth Bede\u2019s cottage. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs. Poyser, however, though she noticed the bonnet, deferred remarking on it until she had disburdened herself of her surprise at Mr. Irwine\u2019s behaviour.

And him a gentleman born, and\u2019s got a mother like a picter. You may go the country round and not find such another woman turned sixty-six. It\u2019s summat-like to see such a man as that i\u2019 the desk of a Sunday! As I say to Poyser, it\u2019s like looking at a full crop o\u2019 wheat, or a pasture with a fine dairy o\u2019 cows in it; it makes you think the world\u2019s comfortable-like. But as for such creaturs as you Methodisses run after, I\u2019d as soon go to look at a lot o\u2019 bare-ribbed runts on a common. Fine folks they are to tell you what\u2019s right, as look as if they\u2019d never tasted nothing better than bacon-sword and sour-cake i\u2019 their lives.

Thias Bede was drowned last night in the Willow Brook, and I\u2019m thinking that the aged mother will be greatly in need of comfort.

But you must have a cup o\u2019 tea first, child,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser, falling at once from the key of B with five sharps to the frank and genial C. \u201cThe kettle\u2019s boiling\u2014we\u2019ll have it ready in a minute; and the young uns \u2019ull be in and wanting theirs directly.

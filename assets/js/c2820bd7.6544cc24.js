She was not theologically instructed enough to discern very clearly the relation between the sacred documents of the past which she opened without method, and her own obscure, simple life; but the spirit of rectitude, and the sense of responsibility for the effect of her conduct on others, which were strong elements in Nancy\u2019s character, had made it a habit with her to scrutinize her past feelings and actions with self-questioning solicitude. Her mind not being courted by a great variety of subjects, she filled the vacant moments by living inwardly, again and again, through all her remembered experience, especially through the fifteen years of her married time, in which her life and its significance had been doubled. She recalled the small details, the words, tones, and looks, in the critical scenes which had opened a new epoch for her by giving her a deeper insight into the relations and trials of life, or which had called on her for some little effort of forbearance, or of painful adherence to an imagined or real duty\u2014asking herself continually whether she had been in any respect blamable. This excessive rumination and self-questioning is perhaps a morbid habit inevitable to a mind of much moral sensibility when shut out from its due share of outward activity and of practical claims on its affections\u2014inevitable to a noble-hearted, childless woman, when her lot is narrow. \u201cI can do so little\u2014have I done it all well?\u201d is the perpetually recurring thought; and there are no voices calling her away from that soliloquy, no peremptory demands to divert energy from vain regret or superfluous scruple. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"There was one main thread of painful experience in Nancy\u2019s married life, and on it hung certain deeply-felt scenes, which were the oftenest revived in retrospect. The short dialogue with Priscilla in the garden had determined the current of retrospect in that frequent direction this particular Sunday afternoon. The first wandering of her thought from the text, which she still attempted dutifully to follow with her eyes and silent lips, was into an imaginary enlargement of the defence she had set up for her husband against Priscilla\u2019s implied blame. The vindication of the loved object is the best balm affection can find for its wounds:\u2014\u201cA man must have so much on his mind,\u201d is the belief by which a wife often supports a cheerful face under rough answers and unfeeling words.

Had she really been right in the resistance which had cost her so much pain six years ago, and again four years ago\u2014the resistance to her husband\u2019s wish that they should adopt a child? Adoption was more remote from the ideas and habits of that time than of our own; still Nancy had her opinion on it. It was as necessary to her mind to have an opinion on all topics, not exclusively masculine, that had come under her notice, as for her to have a precisely marked place for every article of her personal property: and her opinions were always principles to be unwaveringly acted on. They were firm, not because of their basis, but because she held them with a tenacity inseparable from her mental action. On all the duties and proprieties of life, from filial behaviour to the arrangements of the evening toilette, pretty Nancy Lammeter, by the time she was three-and-twenty, had her unalterable little code, and had formed every one of her habits in strict accordance with that code. She carried these decided judgments within her in the most unobtrusive way: they rooted themselves in her mind, and grew there as quietly as grass. Years ago, we know, she insisted on dressing like Priscilla, because \u201cit was right for sisters to dress alike\u201d, and because \u201cshe would do what was right if she wore a gown dyed with cheese-colouring\u201d. That was a trivial but typical instance of the mode in which Nancy\u2019s life was regulated. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"It was one of those rigid principles, and no petty egoistic feeling, which had been the ground of Nancy\u2019s difficult resistance to her husband\u2019s wish. To adopt a child, because children of your own had been denied you, was to try and choose your lot in spite of Providence: the adopted child, she was convinced, would never turn out well, and would be a curse to those who had wilfully and rebelliously sought what it was clear that, for some high reason, they were better without. When you saw a thing was not meant to be, said Nancy, it was a bounden duty to leave off so much as wishing for it. And so far, perhaps, the wisest of men could scarcely make more than a verbal improvement in her principle. But the conditions under which she held it apparent that a thing was not meant to be, depended on a more peculiar mode of thinking. She would have given up making a purchase at a particular place if, on three successive times, rain, or some other cause of Heaven\u2019s sending, had formed an obstacle; and she would have anticipated a broken limb or other heavy misfortune to any one who persisted in spite of such indications.

Was it not an appropriate thing for people in a higher station to take a charge off the hands of a man in a lower?

This was rather a coarse mode of estimating Silas\u2019s relation to Eppie; but we must remember that many of the impressions which Godfrey was likely to gather concerning the labouring people around him would favour the idea that deep affections can hardly go along with callous palms and scant means; and he had not had the opportunity, even if he had had the power, of entering intimately into all that was exceptional in the weaver\u2019s experience.

It seemed to him impossible that he should ever confess to her the truth about Eppie: she would never recover from the repulsion the story of his earlier marriage would create, told to her now, after that long concealment. And the child, too, he thought, must become an object of repulsion: the very sight of her would be painful.

Why did his mind fly uneasily to that void, as if it were the sole reason why life was not thoroughly joyous to him? I suppose it is the way with all men and women who reach middle age without the clear perception that life never ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"can")," be thoroughly joyous: under the vague dullness of the grey hours, dissatisfaction seeks a definite object, and finds it in the privation of an untried good. Dissatisfaction seated musingly on a childless hearth, thinks with envy of the father whose return is greeted by young voices\u2014seated at the meal where the little heads rise one above another like nursery plants, it sees a black care hovering behind every one of them, and thinks the impulses by which men abandon freedom, and seek for ties, are surely nothing but a brief madness. In Godfrey\u2019s case there were further reasons why his thoughts should be continually solicited by this one point in his lot: his conscience, never thoroughly easy about Eppie, now gave his childless home the aspect of a retribution; and as the time passed on, under Nancy\u2019s refusal to adopt her, any retrieval of his error became more and more difficult.

Aged people feel the miss of children: what would father do without Priscilla? And if I die, Godfrey will be very lonely\u2014not holding together with his brothers much. But I won\u2019t be over-anxious, and trying to make things out beforehand: I must do my best for the present.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"With that last thought Nancy roused herself from her reverie, and turned her eyes again towards the forsaken page. It had been forsaken longer than she imagined, for she was presently surprised by the appearance of the servant with the tea-things. It was, in fact, a little before the usual time for tea; but Jane had her reasons.

I doubt something\u2019s happened. There\u2019s niver a man to be seen i\u2019 the yard, else I\u2019d send and see. I\u2019ve been up into the top attic, but there\u2019s no seeing anything for trees. I hope nobody\u2019s hurt, that\u2019s all.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cOh, no, I daresay there\u2019s nothing much the matter,\u201d said Nancy. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps Mr. Snell\u2019s bull got out again, as he did before.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cI wish he mayn\u2019t gore anybody then, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Jane, not altogether despising a hypothesis which covered a few imaginary calamities.

She continued to stand, however, looking at the placid churchyard with the long shadows of the gravestones across the bright green hillocks, and at the glowing autumn colours of the Rectory trees beyond. Before such calm external beauty the presence of a vague fear is more distinctly felt\u2014like a raven flapping its slow wing across the sunny air. Nancy wished more and more that Godfrey would come in."))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

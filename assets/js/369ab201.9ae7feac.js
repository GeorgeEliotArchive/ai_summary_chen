As he got warmed with the use of the oar, fixing his mind on the errand before him and the ends he wanted to achieve on Mirah\u2019s account, he experienced, as was wont with him, a quick change of mental light, shifting his point of view to that of the person whom he had been thinking of hitherto chiefly as serviceable to his own purposes, and was inclined to taunt himself with being not much better than an enlisting sergeant, who never troubles himself with the drama that brings him the needful recruits.

That impression was the more sanctioned by a sort of resolved quietude which the persuasion of fulfillment had produced in Mordecai\u2019s manner.

I wish I could perpetuate those two faces, as Titian\u2019s \u201cTribute Money\u201d has perpetuated two types presenting another sort of contrast. Imagine\u2014we all of us can\u2014the pathetic stamp of consumption with its brilliancy of glance to which the sharply-defined structure of features reminding one of a forsaken temple, give already a far-off look as of one getting unwillingly out of reach; and imagine it on a Jewish face naturally accentuated for the expression of an eager mind\u2014the face of a man little above thirty, but with that age upon it which belongs to time lengthened by suffering, the hair and beard, still black, throwing out the yellow pallor of the skin, the difficult breathing giving more decided marking to the mobile nostril, the wasted yellow hands conspicuous on the folded arms: then give to the yearning consumptive glance something of the slowly dying mother\u2019s look, when her one loved son visits her bedside, and the flickering power of gladness leaps out as she says, \u201cMy boy!\u201d\u2014for the sense of spiritual perpetuation in another resembles that maternal transference of self.

The more exquisite quality of Deronda\u2019s nature\u2014that keenly perceptive sympathetic emotiveness which ran along with his speculative tendency\u2014was never more thoroughly tested. He felt nothing that could be called belief in the validity of Mordecai\u2019s impressions concerning him or in the probability of any greatly effective issue: what he felt was a profound sensibility to a cry from the depths of another and accompanying that, the summons to be receptive instead of superciliously prejudging.

The generations are crowding on my narrow life as a bridge: what has been and what is to be are meeting there; and the bridge is breaking. But I have found you. You have come in time. You will take the inheritance which the base son refuses because of the tombs which the plow and harrow may not pass over or the gold-seeker disturb: you will take the sacred inheritance of the Jew.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"Deronda had become as pallid as Mordecai. Quick as an alarm of flood or fire, there spread within him not only a compassionate dread of discouraging this fellowman who urged a prayer as one in the last agony, but also the opposing dread of fatally feeding an illusion, and being hurried on to a self-committal which might turn into a falsity. The peculiar appeal to his tenderness overcame the repulsion that most of us experience under a grasp and speech which assumed to dominate. The difficulty to him was to inflict the accents of hesitation and doubt on this ardent suffering creature, who was crowding too much of his brief being into a moment of perhaps extravagant trust. With exquisite instinct, Deronda, before he opened his lips, placed his palm gently on Mordecai\u2019s straining hand\u2014an act just then equal to many speeches. And after that he said, without haste, as if conscious that he might be wrong, "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cDo you forget what I told you when we first saw each other? Do you remember that I said I was not of your race?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cIt can\u2019t be true,\u201d Mordecai whispered immediately, with no sign of shock. The sympathetic hand still upon him had fortified the feeling which was stronger than those words of denial. There was a perceptible pause, Deronda feeling it impossible to answer, conscious indeed that the assertion \u201cIt can\u2019t be true\u201d\u2014had the pressure of argument for him. Mordecai, too entirely possessed by the supreme importance of the relation between himself and Deronda to have any other care in his speech, followed up that assertion by a second, which came to his lips as a mere sequence of his long-cherished conviction\u2014\u201cYou are not sure of your own origin.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d said Daniel, with an habitual shrinking which made him remove his hands from Mordecai\u2019s, who also relaxed his hold, and fell back into his former leaning position. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cI know it\u2014I know it; what is my life else?\u201d said Mordecai, with a low cry of impatience. \u201cTell me everything: tell me why you deny.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"He could have no conception what that demand was to the hearer\u2014how probingly it touched the hidden sensibility, the vividly conscious reticence of years; how the uncertainty he was insisting on as part of his own hope had always for Daniel been a threatening possibility of painful revelation about his mother. But the moment had influences which were not only new but solemn to Deronda; any evasion here might turn out to be a hateful refusal of some task that belonged to him, some act of due fellowship; in any case it would be a cruel rebuff to a being who was appealing to him as a forlorn hope under the shadow of a coming doom. After a few moments, he said, with a great effort over himself\u2014determined to tell all the truth briefly, "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cI have never known my mother. I have no knowledge about her. I have never called any man father.

As thoughts move within us darkly, and shake us before they are fully discerned\u2014so events\u2014so beings: they are knit with us in the growth of the world.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"Mordecai\u2019s face, which had been illuminated to the utmost in that last declaration of his confidence, changed under Deronda\u2019s words, not only into any show of collapsed trust: the force did not disappear from the expression, but passed from the triumphant into the firmly resistant.

What are we met for, but that you should know. Your doubts lie as light as dust on my belief. I know the philosophies of this time and of other times; if I chose I could answer a summons before their tribunals. I could silence the beliefs which are the mother-tongue of my soul and speak with the rote-learned language of a system, that gives you the spelling of all things, sure of its alphabet covering them all. I could silence them: may not a man silence his awe or his love, and take to finding reasons, which others demand? But if his love lies deeper than any reasons to be found? Man finds his pathways: at first they were foot tracks, as those of the beast in the wilderness: now they are swift and invisible: his thought dives through the ocean, and his wishes thread the air: has he found all the pathways yet? What reaches him, stays with him, rules him: he must accept it, not knowing its pathway. Say, my expectation of you has grown but as false hopes grow. That doubt is in your mind? Well, my expectation was there, and you are come. Men have died of thirst. But I was thirsty, and the water is on my lips! What are doubts to me? In the hour when you come to me and say, \u2018I reject your soul: I know that I am not a Jew: we have no lot in common\u2019\u2014I shall not doubt. I shall be certain\u2014certain that I have been deluded. That hour will never come!\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"Deronda felt a new chord sounding in his speech: it was rather imperious than appealing\u2014had more of conscious power than of the yearning need which had acted as a beseeching grasp on him before. And usually, though he was the reverse of pugnacious, such a change of attitude toward him would have weakened his inclination to admit a claim. But here there was something that balanced his resistance and kept it aloof. This strong man whose gaze was sustainedly calm and his finger-nails pink with health, who was exercised in all questioning, and accused of excessive mental independence, still felt a subduing influence over him in the tenacious certitude of the fragile creature before him, whose pallid yellow nostril was tense with effort as his breath labored under the burthen of eager speech. The influence seemed to strengthen the bond of sympathetic obligation. In Deronda at this moment the desire to escape what might turn into a trying embarrassment was no more likely to determine action than the solicitations of indolence are likely to determine it in one with whom industry is a daily law. He answered simply, "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cIt is my wish to meet and satisfy your wishes wherever that is possible to me.

He was an elderly son of Abraham, whose childhood had fallen on the evil times at the beginning of this century, and who remained amid this smart and instructed generation as a preserved specimen, soaked through and through with the effect of the poverty and contempt which were the common heritage of most English Jews seventy years ago. He had none of the oily cheerfulness observable in Mr. Cohen\u2019s aspect: his very features\u2014broad and chubby\u2014showed that tendency to look mongrel without due cause, which, in a miscellaneous London neighborhood, may perhaps be compared with the marvels of imitation in insects, and may have been nature\u2019s imperfect effort on behalf of the pure Caucasian to shield him from the shame and spitting to which purer features would have been exposed in the times of zeal. Mr. Ram dealt ably in books, in the same way that he would have dealt in tins of meat and other commodities\u2014without knowledge or responsibility as to the proportion of rottenness or nourishment they might contain. But he believed in Mordecai\u2019s learning as something marvellous, and was not sorry that his conversation should be sought by a bookish gentleman, whose visits had twice ended in a purchase. He greeted Deronda with a crabbed good-will, and, putting on large silver spectacles, appeared at once to abstract himself in the daily accounts.

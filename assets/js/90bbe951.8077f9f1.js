Why, they\u2019re stables four times as big as Squire Cass\u2019s, for he thought o\u2019 nothing but hosses and hunting, Cliff didn\u2019t\u2014a Lunnon tailor, some folks said, as had gone mad wi\u2019 cheating. For he couldn\u2019t ride; lor bless you! they said he\u2019d got no more grip o\u2019 the hoss than if his legs had been cross-sticks: my grandfather heared old Squire Cass say so many and many a time. But ride he would, as if Old Harry had been a-driving him; and he\u2019d a son, a lad o\u2019 sixteen; and nothing would his father have him do, but he must ride and ride\u2014though the lad was frighted, they said. And it was a common saying as the father wanted to ride the tailor out o\u2019 the lad, and make a gentleman on him\u2014not but what I\u2019m a tailor myself, but in respect as God made me such, I\u2019m proud on it, for \u201cMacey, tailor\u201d, \u2019s been wrote up over our door since afore the Queen\u2019s heads went out on the shillings. But Cliff, he was ashamed o\u2019 being called a tailor, and he was sore vexed as his riding was laughed at, and nobody o\u2019 the gentlefolks hereabout could abide him. Howsomever, the poor lad got sickly and died, and the father didn\u2019t live long after him, for he got queerer nor ever, and they said he used to go out i\u2019 the dead o\u2019 the night, wi\u2019 a lantern in his hand, to the stables, and set a lot o\u2019 lights burning, for he got as he couldn\u2019t sleep; and there he\u2019d stand, cracking his whip and looking at his hosses; and they said it was a mercy as the stables didn\u2019t get burnt down wi\u2019 the poor dumb creaturs in \u2019em. But at last he died raving, and they found as he\u2019d left all his property, Warrens and all, to a Lunnon Charity, and that\u2019s how the Warrens come to be Charity Land; though, as for the stables, Mr. Lammeter never uses \u2019em\u2014they\u2019re out o\u2019 all charicter\u2014lor bless you! if you was to set the doors a-banging in \u2019em, it \u2019ud sound like thunder half o\u2019er the parish.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cAye, but there\u2019s more going on in the stables than what folks see by daylight, eh, Mr. Macey?\u201d said the landlord.

Mrs. Meyrick, to whom Deronda had confided everything except Mordecai\u2019s peculiar relation to himself, had been active in helping him to find a suitable lodging in Brompton, not many minutes\u2019 walk from her own house, so that the brother and sister would be within reach of her motherly care. Her happy mixture of Scottish fervor and Gaelic liveliness had enabled her to keep the secret close from the girls as well as from Hans, any betrayal to them being likely to reach Mirah in some way that would raise an agitating suspicion, and spoil the important opening of that work which was to secure her independence, as we rather arbitrarily call one of the more arduous and dignified forms of our dependence. And both Mrs. Meyrick and Deronda had more reasons than they could have expressed for desiring that Mirah should be able to maintain herself. Perhaps \u201cthe little mother\u201d was rather helped in her secrecy by some dubiousness in her sentiment about the remarkable brother described to her; and certainly if she felt any joy and anticipatory admiration, it was due to her faith in Deronda\u2019s judgment. The consumption was a sorrowful fact that appealed to her tenderness; but how was she to be very glad of an enthusiasm which, to tell the truth, she could only contemplate as Jewish pertinacity, and as rather an undesirable introduction among them all of a man whose conversation would not be more modern and encouraging than that of Scott\u2019s Covenanters? Her mind was anything but prosaic, and had her soberer share of Mab\u2019s delight in the romance of Mirah\u2019s story and of her abode with them; but the romantic or unusual in real life requires some adaptation. We sit up at night to read about Sakya-Mouni, St. Francis, or Oliver Cromwell; but whether we should be glad for any one at all like them to call on us the next morning, still more, to reveal himself as a new relation, is quite another affair. Besides, Mrs. Meyrick had hoped, as her children did, that the intensity of Mirah\u2019s feeling about Judaism would slowly subside, and be merged in the gradually deepening current of loving interchange with her new friends. In fact, her secret favorite continuation of the romance had been no discovery of Jewish relations, but something much more favorable to the hopes she discerned in Hans.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"In the wide-open ears of Jacob his father\u2019s words sounded like a doom, giving an awful finish to the dirge-like effect of the whole announcement. His face had been gathering a wondering incredulous sorrow at the notion of Mordecai\u2019s going away: he was unable to imagine the change as anything lasting; but at the mention of \u201chard times for Jacob\u201d there was no further suspense of feeling, and he broke forth in loud lamentation. Adelaide Rebekah always cried when her brother cried, and now began to howl with astonishing suddenness, whereupon baby awaking contributed angry screams, and required to be taken out of the cradle. A great deal of hushing was necessary, and Mordecai feeling the cries pierce him, put out his arms to Jacob, who in the midst of his tears and sobs was turning his head right and left for general observation. His father, who had been saying, \u201cNever mind, old man; you shall go to the riders,\u201d now released him, and he went to Mordecai, who clasped him, and laid his cheek on the little black head without speaking. But Cohen, sensible that the master of the family must make some apology for all this weakness, and that the occasion called for a speech, addressed Deronda with some elevation of pitch, squaring his elbows and resting a hand on each knee: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cIt\u2019s not as we\u2019re the people to grudge anybody\u2019s good luck, sir, or the portion of their cup being made fuller, as I may say. I\u2019m not an envious man, and if anybody offered to set up Mordecai in a shop of my sort two doors lower down, ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I")," shouldn\u2019t make wry faces about it. I\u2019m not one of them that had need have a poor opinion of themselves, and be frightened at anybody else getting a chance. If I\u2019m offal, let a wise man come and tell me, for I\u2019ve never heard it yet. And in point of business, I\u2019m not a class of goods to be in danger. If anybody takes to rolling me, I can pack myself up like a caterpillar, and find my feet when I\u2019m let alone. And though, as I may say, you\u2019re taking some of our good works from us, which is property bearing interest, I\u2019m not saying but we can afford that, though my mother and my wife had the good will to wish and do for Mordecai to the last; and a Jew must not be like a servant who works for reward\u2014though I see nothing against a reward if I can get it. And as to the extra outlay in schooling, I\u2019m neither poor nor greedy\u2014I wouldn\u2019t hang myself for sixpence, nor half a crown neither. But the truth of it is, the women and children are fond of Mordecai. You may partly see how it is, sir, by your own sense. A Jewish man is bound to thank God, day by day, that he was not made a woman; but a woman has to thank God that He has made her according to His will. And we all know what He has made her\u2014a child-bearing, tender-hearted thing is the woman of our people. Her children are mostly stout, as I think you\u2019ll say Addy\u2019s are, and she\u2019s not mushy, but her heart is tender. So you must excuse present company, sir, for not being glad all at once. And as to this young lady\u2014for by what you say \u2018young lady\u2019 is the proper term\u201d\u2014Cohen here threw some additional emphasis into his look and tone\u2014\u201cwe shall all be glad for Mordecai\u2019s sake by-and-by, when we cast up our accounts and see where we are.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"Before Deronda could summon any answer to this oddly mixed speech, Mordecai exclaimed, "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cFriends, friends! For food and raiment and shelter I would not have sought better than you have given me. You have sweetened the morsel with love; and what I thought of as a joy that would be left to me even in the last months of my waning strength was to go on teaching the lad. But now I am as one who had clad himself beforehand in his shroud, and used himself to making the grave his bed, when the divine command sounded in his ears, \u2018Arise, and go forth; the night is not yet come.\u2019 For no light matter would I have turned away from your kindness to take another\u2019s.

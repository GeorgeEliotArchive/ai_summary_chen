"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cKeep yourself quiet, my lad,\u201d said Bartle; \u201ckeep quiet. It\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking of. It\u2019s the young Methodist woman come from the prison. She\u2019s at the bottom o\u2019 the stairs, and wants to know if you think well to see her, for she has something to say to you about that poor castaway; but she wouldn\u2019t come in without your leave, she said.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He was standing with his face towards the door, and as Dinah entered, lifting up her mild grey eyes towards him, she saw at once the great change that had come since the day when she had looked up at the tall man in the cottage. There was a trembling in her clear voice as she put her hand into his and said, \u201cBe comforted, Adam Bede, the Lord has not forsaken her.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBless you for coming to her,\u201d Adam said. \u201cMr. Massey brought me word yesterday as you was come.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  They could neither of them say any more just yet, but stood before each other in silence; and Bartle Massey, too, who had put on his spectacles, seemed transfixed, examining Dinah\u2019s face.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThank you, friend; I won\u2019t sit down,\u201d said Dinah, \u201cfor I must hasten back. She entreated me not to stay long away.

Although her poor soul is very dark and discerns little beyond the things of the flesh, she is no longer hard. She is contrite, she has confessed all to me. The pride of her heart has given way, and she leans on me for help and desires to be taught. This fills me with trust, for I cannot but think that the brethren sometimes err in measuring the Divine love by the sinner\u2019s knowledge. She is going to write a letter to the friends at the Hall Farm for me to give them when she is gone, and when I told her you were here, she said, \u2018I should like to say good-bye to Adam and ask him to forgive me.\u2019 You will come, Adam?

She used never to make any return to my affection before, but now tribulation has opened her heart. Farewell, Adam. Our heavenly Father comfort you and strengthen you to bear all things.\u201d Dinah put out her hand, and Adam pressed it in silence. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Bartle Massey was getting up to lift the stiff latch of the door for her, but before he could reach it, she had said gently, \u201cFarewell, friend,\u201d and was gone, with her light step down the stairs. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d said Bartle, taking off his spectacles and putting them into his pocket, \u201cif there must be women to make trouble in the world, it\u2019s but fair there should be women to be comforters under it; and she\u2019s one\u2014she\u2019s one.

The excitement of suspense, heightening with every hour that brought him nearer the fatal moment, was too great, and in spite of his entreaties, in spite of his promises that he would be perfectly quiet, the schoolmaster watched too. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat does it matter to me, lad?\u201d Bartle said: \u201ca night\u2019s sleep more or less? I shall sleep long enough, by and by, underground. Let me keep thee company in trouble while I can.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It was a long and dreary night in that small chamber. Adam would sometimes get up and tread backwards and forwards along the short space from wall to wall; then he would sit down and hide his face, and no sound would be heard but the ticking of the watch on the table, or the falling of a cinder from the fire which the schoolmaster carefully tended. Sometimes he would burst out into vehement speech, "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIf I could ha\u2019 done anything to save her\u2014if my bearing anything would ha\u2019 done any good... but t\u2019 have to sit still, and know it, and do nothing... it\u2019s hard for a man to bear... and to think o\u2019 what might ha\u2019 been now, if it hadn\u2019t been for ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"him"),"....

But you must remember this: when you thought of marrying her, you\u2019d a notion she\u2019d got another sort of a nature inside her.

How could I think any other way? And if he\u2019d never come near her, and I\u2019d married her, and been loving to her, and took care of her, she might never ha\u2019 done anything bad. What would it ha\u2019 signified\u2014my having a bit o\u2019 trouble with her? It \u2019ud ha\u2019 been nothing to this.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere\u2019s no knowing, my lad\u2014there\u2019s no knowing what might have come. The smart\u2019s bad for you to bear now: you must have time\u2014you must have time. But I\u2019ve that opinion of you, that you\u2019ll rise above it all and be a man again, and there may good come out of this that we don\u2019t see.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGood come out of it!\u201d said Adam passionately. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t alter th\u2019 evil: ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her")," ruin can\u2019t be undone. I hate that talk o\u2019 people, as if there was a way o\u2019 making amends for everything. They\u2019d more need be brought to see as the wrong they do can never be altered. When a man\u2019s spoiled his fellow-creatur\u2019s life, he\u2019s no right to comfort himself with thinking good may come out of it. Somebody else\u2019s good doesn\u2019t alter her shame and misery.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, lad, well,\u201d said Bartle, in a gentle tone, strangely in contrast with his usual peremptoriness and impatience of contradiction, \u201cit\u2019s likely enough I talk foolishness. I\u2019m an old fellow, and it\u2019s a good many years since I was in trouble myself. It\u2019s easy finding reasons why other folks should be patient.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMr. Massey,\u201d said Adam penitently, \u201cI\u2019m very hot and hasty.

There would soon be no more suspense. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet us go to the prison now, Mr. Massey,\u201d said Adam, when he saw the hand of his watch at six. \u201cIf there\u2019s any news come, we shall hear about it.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The people were astir already, moving rapidly, in one direction, through the streets. Adam tried not to think where they were going, as they hurried past him in that short space between his lodging and the prison gates. He was thankful when the gates shut him in from seeing those eager people. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  No; there was no news come\u2014no pardon\u2014no reprieve. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam lingered in the court half an hour before he could bring himself to send word to Dinah that he was come. But a voice caught his ear: he could not shut out the words. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThe cart is to set off at half-past seven.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It must be said\u2014the last good-bye: there was no help. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  In ten minutes from that time, Adam was at the door of the cell. Dinah had sent him word that she could not come to him; she could not leave Hetty one moment; but Hetty was prepared for the meeting. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He could not see her when he entered, for agitation deadened his senses, and the dim cell was almost dark to him. He stood a moment after the door closed behind him, trembling and stupefied. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  But he began to see through the dimness\u2014to see the dark eyes lifted up to him once more, but with no smile in them. O God, how sad they looked! The last time they had met his was when he parted from her with his heart full of joyous hopeful love, and they looked out with a tearful smile from a pink, dimpled, childish face. The face was marble now; the sweet lips were pallid and half-open and quivering; the dimples were all gone\u2014all but one, that never went; and the eyes\u2014O, the worst of all was the likeness they had to Hetty\u2019s. They were Hetty\u2019s eyes looking at him with that mournful gaze, as if she had come back to him from the dead to tell him of her misery. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  She was clinging close to Dinah; her cheek was against Dinah\u2019s. It seemed as if her last faint strength and hope lay in that contact, and the pitying love that shone out from Dinah\u2019s face looked like a visible pledge of the Invisible Mercy. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  When the sad eyes met\u2014when Hetty and Adam looked at each other\u2014she felt the change in him too, and it seemed to strike her with fresh fear. It was the first time she had seen any being whose face seemed to reflect the change in herself: Adam was a new image of the dreadful past and the dreadful present. She trembled more as she looked at him. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSpeak to him, Hetty,\u201d Dinah said; \u201ctell him what is in your heart.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty obeyed her, like a little child. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAdam... I\u2019m very sorry...

I forgave thee long ago.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It had seemed to Adam as if his brain would burst with the anguish of meeting Hetty\u2019s eyes in the first moments, but the sound of her voice uttering these penitent words touched a chord which had been less strained. There was a sense of relief from what was becoming unbearable, and the rare tears came\u2014they had never come before, since he had hung on Seth\u2019s neck in the beginning of his sorrow. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty made an involuntary movement towards him, some of the love that she had once lived in the midst of was come near her again. She kept hold of Dinah\u2019s hand, but she went up to Adam and said timidly, \u201cWill you kiss me again, Adam, for all I\u2019ve been so wicked?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam took the blanched wasted hand she put out to him, and they gave each other the solemn unspeakable kiss of a lifelong parting. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd tell him,\u201d Hetty said, in rather a stronger voice, \u201ctell him... for there\u2019s nobody else to tell him... as I went after him and couldn\u2019t find him... and I hated him and cursed him once... but Dinah says I should forgive him... and I try... for else God won\u2019t forgive me.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  There was a noise at the door of the cell now\u2014the key was being turned in the lock, and when the door opened, Adam saw indistinctly that there were several faces there. He was too agitated to see more\u2014even to see that Mr. Irwine\u2019s face was one of them. He felt that the last preparations were beginning, and he could stay no longer. Room was silently made for him to depart, and he went to his chamber in loneliness, leaving Bartle Massey to watch and see the end."))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

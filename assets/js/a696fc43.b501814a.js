But there was a terrible dread weighing on his mind, so terrible that he dared not even ask the question which might bring the fatal \u201cyes\u201d; he dared not ask the surgeon or Mr Stelling, \u201cShall I be lame, Sir?\u201d He mastered himself so as not to cry out at the pain; but when his foot had been dressed, and he was left alone with Maggie seated by his bedside, the children sobbed together, with their heads laid on the same pillow. Tom was thinking of himself walking about on crutches, like the wheelwright\u2019s son; and Maggie, who did not guess what was in his mind, sobbed for company. It had not occurred to the surgeon or to Mr Stelling to anticipate this dread in Tom\u2019s mind, and to reassure him by hopeful words. But Philip watched the surgeon out of the house, and waylaid Mr Stelling to ask the very question that Tom had not dared to ask for himself.

Go to his bedroom, but be very quiet at present.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  It had been Philip\u2019s first thought when he heard of the accident,\u2014\u201cWill Tulliver be lame? It will be very hard for him if he is\u201d; and Tom\u2019s hitherto unforgiven offences were washed out by that pity. Philip felt that they were no longer in a state of repulsion, but were being drawn into a common current of suffering and sad privation. His imagination did not dwell on the outward calamity and its future effect on Tom\u2019s life, but it made vividly present to him the probable state of Tom\u2019s feeling. Philip had only lived fourteen years, but those years had, most of them, been steeped in the sense of a lot irremediably hard. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMr Askern says you\u2019ll soon be all right again, Tulliver, did you know?\u201d he said rather timidly, as he stepped gently up to Tom\u2019s bed. \u201cI\u2019ve just been to ask Mr Stelling, and he says you\u2019ll walk as well as ever again by-and-day.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  Tom looked up with that momentary stopping of the breath which comes with a sudden joy; then he gave a long sigh, and turned his blue-gray eyes straight on Philip\u2019s face, as he had not done for a fortnight or more. As for Maggie, this intimation of a possibility she had not thought of before affected her as a new trouble; the bare idea of Tom\u2019s being always lame overpowered the assurance that such a misfortune was not likely to befall him, and she clung to him and cried afresh. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t be a little silly, Magsie,\u201d said Tom, tenderly, feeling very brave now. \u201cI shall soon get well.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGood-by, Tulliver,\u201d said Philip, putting out his small, delicate hand, which Tom clasped immediately with his more substantial fingers.

Tom liked to hear fighting stories as much as ever, but he insisted strongly on the fact that those great fighters who did so many wonderful things and came off unhurt, wore excellent armor from head to foot, which made fighting easy work, he considered. He should not have hurt his foot if he had had an iron shoe on. He listened with great interest to a new story of Philip\u2019s about a man who had a very bad wound in his foot, and cried out so dreadfully with the pain that his friends could bear with him no longer, but put him ashore on a desert island, with nothing but some wonderful poisoned arrows to kill animals with for food. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI didn\u2019t roar out a bit, you know,\u201d Tom said, \u201cand I dare say my foot was as bad as his.

"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  One day, soon after Philip had told this story, he and Maggie were in the study alone together while Tom\u2019s foot was being dressed. Philip was at his books, and Maggie, after sauntering idly round the room, not caring to do anything in particular, because she would soon go to Tom again, went and leaned on the table near Philip to see what he was doing, for they were quite old friends now, and perfectly at home with each other. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat are you reading about in Greek?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s poetry, I can see that, because the lines are so short.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s about Philoctetes, the lame man I was telling you of yesterday,\u201d he answered, resting his head on his hand, and looking at her as if he were not at all sorry to be interrupted. Maggie, in her absent way, continued to lean forward, resting on her arms and moving her feet about, while her dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant, as if she had quite forgotten Philip and his book. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMaggie,\u201d said Philip, after a minute or two, still leaning on his elbow and looking at her, \u201cif you had had a brother like me, do you think you should have loved him as well as Tom?\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie started a little on being roused from her reverie, and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d Philip repeated his question. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, yes, better,\u201d she answered immediately. \u201cNo, not better; because I don\u2019t think I ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"could")," love you better than Tom.

Maggie, young as she was, felt her mistake. Hitherto she had instinctively behaved as if she were quite unconscious of Philip\u2019s deformity; her own keen sensitiveness and experience under family criticism sufficed to teach her this as well as if she had been directed by the most finished breeding. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut you are so very clever, Philip, and you can play and sing,\u201d she added quickly. \u201cI wish you ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"were")," my brother. I\u2019m very fond of you.

And then I shall see you when you\u2019re grown up, and you\u2019ll hardly take any notice of me.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, no, I sha\u2019n\u2019t forget you, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Maggie, shaking her head very seriously. \u201cI never forget anything, and I think about everybody when I\u2019m away from them. I think about poor Yap; he\u2019s got a lump in his throat, and Luke says he\u2019ll die. Only don\u2019t you tell Tom. because it will vex him so. You never saw Yap; he\u2019s a queer little dog,\u2014nobody cares about him but Tom and me.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDo you care as much about me as you do about Yap, Maggie?\u201d said Philip, smiling rather sadly. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, yes, I should think so,\u201d said Maggie, laughing. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m very fond of ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you"),", Maggie; I shall never forget ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you"),",\u201d said Philip, \u201cand when I\u2019m very unhappy, I shall always think of you, and wish I had a sister with dark eyes, just like yours.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy do you like my eyes?\u201d said Maggie, well pleased. She had never heard any one but her father speak of her eyes as if they had merit. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Philip. \u201cThey\u2019re not like any other eyes.

Then, wondering how she could convince Philip that she could like him just as well, although he was crooked, she said: "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cShould you like me to kiss you, as I do Tom?

"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  Tom coloured a little as he looked at his father, and said: \u201cI sha\u2019n\u2019t be friends with him when I leave school, father; but we\u2019ve made it up now, since my foot has been bad, and he\u2019s taught me to play at draughts, and I can beat him.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, well,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, \u201cif he\u2019s good to you, try and make him amends, and be good to ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"him"),". He\u2019s a poor crooked creature, and takes after his dead mother. But don\u2019t you be getting too thick with him; he\u2019s got his father\u2019s blood in him too. Ay, ay, the gray colt may chance to kick like his black sire.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  The jarring natures of the two boys effected what Mr Tulliver\u2019s admonition alone might have failed to effect; in spite of Philip\u2019s new kindness, and Tom\u2019s answering regard in this time of his trouble, they never became close friends. When Maggie was gone, and when Tom by-and-by began to walk about as usual, the friendly warmth that had been kindled by pity and gratitude died out by degrees, and left them in their old relation to each other. Philip was often peevish and contemptuous; and Tom\u2019s more specific and kindly impressions gradually melted into the old background of suspicion and dislike toward him as a queer fellow, a humpback, and the son of a rogue. If boys and men are to be welded together in the glow of transient feeling, they must be made of metal that will mix, else they inevitably fall asunder when the heat dies out."))}y.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

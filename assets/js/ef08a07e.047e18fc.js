Mr Riley spoke of such acquaintances kindly as \u201cpeople of the old school.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The conversation had come to a pause. Mr Tulliver, not without a particular reason, had abstained from a seventh recital of the cool retort by which Riley had shown himself too many for Dix, and how Wakem had had his comb cut for once in his life, now the business of the dam had been settled by arbitration, and how there never would have been any dispute at all about the height of water if everybody was what they should be, and Old Harry hadn\u2019t made the lawyers. Mr Tulliver was, on the whole, a man of safe traditional opinions; but on one or two points he had trusted to his unassisted intellect, and had arrived at several questionable conclusions; amongst the rest, that rats, weevils, and lawyers were created by Old Harry. Unhappily he had no one to tell him that this was rampant Manich\xe6ism, else he might have seen his error. But to-day it was clear that the good principle was triumphant: this affair of the water-power had been a tangled business somehow, for all it seemed\u2014look at it one way\u2014as plain as water\u2019s water; but, big a puzzle as it was, it hadn\u2019t got the better of Riley. Mr Tulliver took his brandy-and-water a little stronger than usual, and, for a man who might be supposed to have a few hundreds lying idle at his banker\u2019s, was rather incautiously open in expressing his high estimate of his friend\u2019s business talents. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But the dam was a subject of conversation that would keep; it could always be taken up again at the same point, and exactly in the same condition; and there was another subject, as you know, on which Mr Tulliver was in pressing want of Mr Riley\u2019s advice. This was his particular reason for remaining silent for a short space after his last draught, and rubbing his knees in a meditative manner. He was not a man to make an abrupt transition. This was a puzzling world, as he often said, and if you drive your wagon in a hurry, you may light on an awkward corner. Mr Riley, meanwhile, was not impatient. Why should he be? Even Hotspur, one would think, must have been patient in his slippers on a warm hearth, taking copious snuff, and sipping gratuitous brandy-and-water.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh!\u201d said Mr Riley, in a tone of mild interest. He was a man with heavy waxen eyelids and high-arched eyebrows, looking exactly the same under all circumstances.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s a very particular thing,\u201d he went on; \u201cit\u2019s about my boy Tom.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  At the sound of this name, Maggie, who was seated on a low stool close by the fire, with a large book open on her lap, shook her heavy hair back and looked up eagerly. There were few sounds that roused Maggie when she was dreaming over her book, but Tom\u2019s name served as well as the shrillest whistle; in an instant she was on the watch, with gleaming eyes, like a Skye terrier suspecting mischief, or at all events determined to fly at any one who threatened it toward Tom. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou see, I want to put him to a new school at Midsummer,\u201d said Mr Tulliver; \u201che\u2019s comin\u2019 away from the \u2019cademy at Lady-day, an\u2019 I shall let him run loose for a quarter; but after that I want to send him to a downright good school, where they\u2019ll make a scholard of him.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d said Mr Riley, \u201cthere\u2019s no greater advantage you can give him than a good education.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  These angry symptoms were keenly observed by Maggie, and cut her to the quick. Tom, it appeared, was supposed capable of turning his father out of doors, and of making the future in some way tragic by his wickedness. This was not to be borne; and Maggie jumped up from her stool, forgetting all about her heavy book, which fell with a bang within the fender, and going up between her father\u2019s knees, said, in a half-crying, half-indignant voice,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cFather, Tom wouldn\u2019t be naughty to you ever; I know he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver was out of the room superintending a choice supper-dish, and Mr Tulliver\u2019s heart was touched; so Maggie was not scolded about the book. Mr Riley quietly picked it up and looked at it, while the father laughed, with a certain tenderness in his hard-lined face, and patted his little girl on the back, and then held her hands and kept her between his knees. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat! they mustn\u2019t say any harm o\u2019 Tom, eh?\u201d said Mr Tulliver, looking at Maggie with a twinkling eye.

She thought Mr Riley would have a respect for her now; it had been evident that he thought nothing of her before. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Riley was turning over the leaves of the book, and she could make nothing of his face, with its high-arched eyebrows; but he presently looked at her, and said,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCome, come and tell me something about this book; here are some pictures,\u2014I want to know what they mean.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie, with deepening colour, went without hesitation to Mr Riley\u2019s elbow and looked over the book, eagerly seizing one corner, and tossing back her mane, while she said,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, I\u2019ll tell you what that means.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, now, let\u2019s hear,\u201d he said, adjusting himself in his chair with the complacency of a person who is thought worthy of important communications. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHe\u2019s an Oxford man,\u201d said Mr Riley, sententiously, shutting his mouth close, and looking at Mr Tulliver to observe the effect of this stimulating information. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat! a parson?\u201d said Mr Tulliver, rather doubtfully. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, and an M.A. The bishop, I understand, thinks very highly of him: why, it was the bishop who got him his present curacy.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh?\u201d said Mr Tulliver, to whom one thing was as wonderful as another concerning these unfamiliar phenomena. \u201cBut what can he want wi\u2019 Tom, then?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, the fact is, he\u2019s fond of teaching, and wishes to keep up his studies, and a clergyman has but little opportunity for that in his parochial duties. He\u2019s willing to take one or two boys as pupils to fill up his time profitably. The boys would be quite of the family,\u2014the finest thing in the world for them; under Stelling\u2019s eye continually.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut do you think they\u2019d give the poor lad twice o\u2019 pudding?\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, who was now in her place again. \u201cHe\u2019s such a boy for pudding as never was; an\u2019 a growing boy like that,\u2014it\u2019s dreadful to think o\u2019 their stintin\u2019 him.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd what money \u2019ud he want?\u201d said Mr Tulliver, whose instinct told him that the services of this admirable M.A. would bear a high price. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, I know of a clergyman who asks a hundred and fifty with his youngest pupils, and he\u2019s not to be mentioned with Stelling, the man I speak of. I know, on good authority, that one of the chief people at Oxford said, Stelling might get the highest honours if he chose. But he didn\u2019t care about university honours; he\u2019s a quiet man\u2014not noisy.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, a deal better\u2014a deal better,\u201d said Mr Tulliver; \u201cbut a hundred and fifty\u2019s an uncommon price. I never thought o\u2019 paying so much as that.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cA good education, let me tell you, Tulliver,\u2014a good education is cheap at the money. But Stelling is moderate in his terms; he\u2019s not a grasping man. I\u2019ve no doubt he\u2019d take your boy at a hundred, and that\u2019s what you wouldn\u2019t get many other clergymen to do. I\u2019ll write to him about it, if you like.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Tulliver rubbed his knees, and looked at the carpet in a meditative manner. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut belike he\u2019s a bachelor,\u201d observed Mrs Tulliver, in the interval; \u201can\u2019 I\u2019ve no opinion o\u2019 housekeepers. There was my brother, as is dead an\u2019 gone, had a housekeeper once, an\u2019 she took half the feathers out o\u2019 the best bed, an\u2019 packed \u2019em up an\u2019 sent \u2019em away. An\u2019 it\u2019s unknown the linen she made away with\u2014Stott her name was. It \u2019ud break my heart to send Tom where there\u2019s a housekeeper, an\u2019 I hope you won\u2019t think of it, Mr Tulliver.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou may set your mind at rest on that score, Mrs Tulliver,\u201d said Mr Riley, \u201cfor Stelling is married to as nice a little woman as any man need wish for a wife. There isn\u2019t a kinder little soul in the world; I know her family well. She has very much your complexion,\u2014light curly hair. She comes of a good Mudport family, and it\u2019s not every offer that would have been acceptable in that quarter. But Stelling\u2019s not an everyday man; rather a particular fellow as to the people he chooses to be connected with. But I ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"think")," he would have no objection to take your son; I ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"think")," he would not, on my representation.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI don\u2019t know what he could have ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"against")," the lad,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, with a slight touch of motherly indignation; \u201ca nice fresh-skinned lad as anybody need wish to see.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m thinking on,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, turning his head on one side and looking at Mr Riley, after a long perusal of the carpet. \u201cWouldn\u2019t a parson be almost too high-learnt to bring up a lad to be a man o\u2019 business? My notion o\u2019 the parsons was as they\u2019d got a sort o\u2019 learning as lay mostly out o\u2019 sight. And that isn\u2019t what I want for Tom. I want him to know figures, and write like print, and see into things quick, and know what folks mean, and how to wrap things up in words as aren\u2019t actionable. It\u2019s an uncommon fine thing, that is,\u201d concluded Mr Tulliver, shaking his head, \u201cwhen you can let a man know what you think of him without paying for it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, my dear Tulliver,\u201d said Mr Riley, \u201cyou\u2019re quite under a mistake about the clergy; all the best schoolmasters are of the clergy. The schoolmasters who are not clergymen are a very low set of men generally.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, that Jacobs is, at the \u2019cademy,\u201d interposed Mr Tulliver. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTo be sure,\u2014men who have failed in other trades, most likely. Now, a clergyman is a gentleman by profession and education; and besides that, he has the knowledge that will ground a boy, and prepare him for entering on any career with credit. There may be some clergymen who are mere bookmen; but you may depend upon it, Stelling is not one of them,\u2014a man that\u2019s wide awake, let me tell you. Drop him a hint, and that\u2019s enough. You talk of figures, now; you have only to say to Stelling, \u2018I want my son to be a thorough arithmetician,\u2019 and you may leave the rest to him.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Riley paused a moment, while Mr Tulliver, somewhat reassured as to clerical tutorship, was inwardly rehearsing to an imaginary Mr Stelling the statement, \u201cI want my son to know \u2019rethmetic.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou see, my dear Tulliver,\u201d Mr Riley continued, \u201cwhen you get a thoroughly educated man, like Stelling, he\u2019s at no loss to take up any branch of instruction. When a workman knows the use of his tools, he can make a door as well as a window.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, that\u2019s true,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, almost convinced now that the clergy must be the best of schoolmasters. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll do for you,\u201d said Mr Riley, \u201cand I wouldn\u2019t do it for everybody. I\u2019ll see Stelling\u2019s father-in-law, or drop him a line when I get back to Mudport, to say that you wish to place your boy with his son-in-law, and I dare say Stelling will write to you, and send you his terms.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut there\u2019s no hurry, is there?\u201d said Mrs Tulliver; \u201cfor I hope, Mr Tulliver, you won\u2019t let Tom begin at his new school before Midsummer. He began at the \u2019cademy at the Lady-day quarter, and you see what good\u2019s come of it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, ay, Bessy, never brew wi\u2019 bad malt upo\u2019 Michaelmas day, else you\u2019ll have a poor tap,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, winking and smiling at Mr Riley, with the natural pride of a man who has a buxom wife conspicuously his inferior in intellect. \u201cBut it\u2019s true there\u2019s no hurry; you\u2019ve hit it there, Bessy.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt might be as well not to defer the arrangement too long,\u201d said Mr Riley, quietly, \u201cfor Stelling may have propositions from other parties, and I know he would not take more than two or three boarders, if so many. If I were you, I think I would enter on the subject with Stelling at once: there\u2019s no necessity for sending the boy before Midsummer, but I would be on the safe side, and make sure that nobody forestalls you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, there\u2019s summat in that,\u201d said Mr Tulliver. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cFather,\u201d broke in Maggie, who had stolen unperceived to her father\u2019s elbow again, listening with parted lips, while she held her doll topsy-turvy, and crushed its nose against the wood of the chair,\u2014\u201cfather, is it a long way off where Tom is to go? Sha\u2019n\u2019t we ever go to see him?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI don\u2019t know, my wench,\u201d said the father, tenderly. \u201cAsk Mr Riley; he knows.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie came round promptly in front of Mr Riley, and said, \u201cHow far is it, please, sir?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, a long, long way off,\u201d that gentleman answered, being of opinion that children, when they are not naughty, should always be spoken to jocosely. \u201cYou must borrow the seven-leagued boots to get to him.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense!\u201d said Maggie, tossing her head haughtily, and turning away, with the tears springing in her eyes. She began to dislike Mr Riley; it was evident he thought her silly and of no consequence. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHush, Maggie! for shame of you, asking questions and chattering,\u201d said her mother. \u201cCome and sit down on your little stool, and hold your tongue, do. But,\u201d added Mrs Tulliver, who had her own alarm awakened, \u201cis it so far off as I couldn\u2019t wash him and mend him?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAbout fifteen miles; that\u2019s all,\u201d said Mr Riley. \u201cYou can drive there and back in a day quite comfortably. Or\u2014Stelling is a hospitable, pleasant man\u2014he\u2019d be glad to have you stay.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut it\u2019s too far off for the linen, I doubt,\u201d said Mrs Tulliver, sadly. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The entrance of supper opportunely adjourned this difficulty, and relieved Mr Riley from the labour of suggesting some solution or compromise,\u2014a labour which he would otherwise doubtless have undertaken; for, as you perceive, he was a man of very obliging manners. And he had really given himself the trouble of recommending Mr Stelling to his friend Tulliver without any positive expectation of a solid, definite advantage resulting to himself, notwithstanding the subtle indications to the contrary which might have misled a too sagacious observer. For there is nothing more widely misleading than sagacity if it happens to get on a wrong scent; and sagacity, persuaded that men usually act and speak from distinct motives, with a consciously proposed end in view, is certain to waste its energies on imaginary game. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivance, in order to compass a selfish end, are nowhere abundant but in the world of the dramatist: they demand too intense a mental action for many of our fellow-parishioners to be guilty of them. It is easy enough to spoil the lives of our neighbours without taking so much trouble; we can do it by lazy acquiescence and lazy omission, by trivial falsities for which we hardly know a reason, by small frauds neutralised by small extravagances, by maladroit flatteries, and clumsily improvised insinuations. We live from hand to mouth, most of us, with a small family of immediate desires; we do little else than snatch a morsel to satisfy the hungry brood, rarely thinking of seed-corn or the next year\u2019s crop. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Riley was a man of business, and not cold toward his own interest, yet even he was more under the influence of small promptings than of far-sighted designs. He had no private understanding with the Rev. Walter Stelling; on the contrary, he knew very little of that M.A. and his acquirements,\u2014not quite enough, perhaps, to warrant so strong a recommendation of him as he had given to his friend Tulliver. But he believed Mr Stelling to be an excellent classic, for Gadsby had said so, and Gadsby\u2019s first cousin was an Oxford tutor; which was better ground for the belief even than his own immediate observation would have been, for though Mr Riley had received a tincture of the classics at the great Mudport Free School, and had a sense of understanding Latin generally, his comprehension of any particular Latin was not ready. Doubtless there remained a subtle aroma from his juvenile contact with the ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"De Senectute")," and the fourth book of the ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"\xc6neid"),", but it had ceased to be distinctly recognisable as classical, and was only perceived in the higher finish and force of his auctioneering style. Then, Stelling was an Oxford man, and the Oxford men were always\u2014no, no, it was the Cambridge men who were always good mathematicians. But a man who had had a university education could teach anything he liked; especially a man like Stelling, who had made a speech at a Mudport dinner on a political occasion, and had acquitted himself so well that it was generally remarked, this son-in-law of Timpson\u2019s was a sharp fellow. It was to be expected of a Mudport man, from the parish of St Ursula, that he would not omit to do a good turn to a son-in-law of Timpson\u2019s, for Timpson was one of the most useful and influential men in the parish, and had a good deal of business, which he knew how to put into the right hands. Mr Riley liked such men, quite apart from any money which might be diverted, through their good judgment, from less worthy pockets into his own; and it would be a satisfaction to him to say to Timpson on his return home, \u201cI\u2019ve secured a good pupil for your son-in-law.\u201d Timpson had a large family of daughters; Mr Riley felt for him; besides, Louisa Timpson\u2019s face, with its light curls, had been a familiar object to him over the pew wainscot on a Sunday for nearly fifteen years; it was natural her husband should be a commendable tutor. Moreover, Mr Riley knew of no other schoolmaster whom he had any ground for recommending in preference; why, then, should he not recommend Stelling? His friend Tulliver had asked him for an opinion; it is always chilling, in friendly intercourse, to say you have no opinion to give. And if you deliver an opinion at all, it is mere stupidity not to do it with an air of conviction and well-founded knowledge. You make it your own in uttering it, and naturally get fond of it. Thus Mr Riley, knowing no harm of Stelling to begin with, and wishing him well, so far as he had any wishes at all concerning him, had no sooner recommended him than he began to think with admiration of a man recommended on such high authority, and would soon have gathered so warm an interest on the subject, that if Mr Tulliver had in the end declined to send Tom to Stelling, Mr Riley would have thought his \u201cfriend of the old school\u201d a thoroughly pig-headed fellow. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  If you blame Mr Riley very severely for giving a recommendation on such slight grounds, I must say you are rather hard upon him. Why should an auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago, who had as good as forgotten his free-school Latin, be expected to manifest a delicate scrupulosity which is not always exhibited by gentlemen of the learned professions, even in our present advanced stage of morality? "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Besides, a man with the milk of human kindness in him can scarcely abstain from doing a good-natured action, and one cannot be good-natured all round. Nature herself occasionally quarters an inconvenient parasite on an animal toward whom she has otherwise no ill will. What then? We admire her care for the parasite. If Mr Riley had shrunk from giving a recommendation that was not based on valid evidence, he would not have helped Mr Stelling to a paying pupil, and that would not have been so well for the reverend gentleman. Consider, too, that all the pleasant little dim ideas and complacencies\u2014of standing well with Timpson, of dispensing advice when he was asked for it, of impressing his friend Tulliver with additional respect, of saying something, and saying it emphatically, with other inappreciably minute ingredients that went along with the warm hearth and the brandy-and-water to make up Mr Riley\u2019s consciousness on this occasion\u2014would have been a mere blank."))}y.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

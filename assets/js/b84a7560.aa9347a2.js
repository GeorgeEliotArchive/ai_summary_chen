It had a faint scent of roses, which made her feel as if Arthur were close to her. She put it to her lips, and a rush of remembered sensations for a moment or two swept away all fear.

If I say anything to pain you in this letter, do not believe it is for want of love and tenderness towards you, for there is nothing I would not do for you, if I knew it to be really for your happiness. I cannot bear to think of my little Hetty shedding tears when I am not there to kiss them away; and if I followed only my own inclinations, I should be with her at this moment instead of writing.

The fault has all been mine, for though I have been unable to resist the longing to be near you, I have felt all the while that your affection for me might cause you grief. I ought to have resisted my feelings. I should have done so, if I had been a better fellow than I am; but now, since the past cannot be altered, I am bound to save you from any evil that I have power to prevent. And I feel it would be a great evil for you if your affections continued so fixed on me that you could think of no other man who might be able to make you happier by his love than I ever can, and if you continued to look towards something in the future which cannot possibly happen. For, dear Hetty, if I were to do what you one day spoke of, and make you my wife, I should do what you yourself would come to feel was for your misery instead of your welfare. I know you can never be happy except by marrying a man in your own station; and if I were to marry you now, I should only be adding to any wrong I have done, besides offending against my duty in the other relations of life.

Hetty did not see the face\u2014she saw nothing\u2014she only felt that she was cold and sick and trembling. The letter shook and rustled in her hand. She laid it down. It was a horrible sensation\u2014this cold and trembling. It swept away the very ideas that produced it, and Hetty got up to reach a warm cloak from her clothes-press, wrapped it round her, and sat as if she were thinking of nothing but getting warm. Presently she took up the letter with a firmer hand, and began to read it through again. The tears came this time\u2014great rushing tears that blinded her and blotched the paper. She felt nothing but that Arthur was cruel\u2014cruel to write so, cruel not to marry her. Reasons why he could not marry her had no existence for her mind; how could she believe in any misery that could come to her from the fulfilment of all she had been longing for and dreaming of? She had not the ideas that could make up the notion of that misery. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  As she threw down the letter again, she caught sight of her face in the glass; it was reddened now, and wet with tears; it was almost like a companion that she might complain to\u2014that would pity her. She leaned forward on her elbows, and looked into those dark overflooding eyes and at the quivering mouth, and saw how the tears came thicker and thicker, and how the mouth became convulsed with sobs. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The shattering of all her little dream-world, the crushing blow on her new-born passion, afflicted her pleasure-craving nature with an overpowering pain that annihilated all impulse to resistance, and suspended her anger. She sat sobbing till the candle went out, and then, wearied, aching, stupefied with crying, threw herself on the bed without undressing and went to sleep. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There was a feeble dawn in the room when Hetty awoke, a little after four o\u2019clock, with a sense of dull misery, the cause of which broke upon her gradually as she began to discern the objects round her in the dim light. And then came the frightening thought that she had to conceal her misery as well as to bear it, in this dreary daylight that was coming. She could lie no longer. She got up and went towards the table: there lay the letter. She opened her treasure-drawer: there lay the ear-rings and the locket\u2014the signs of all her short happiness\u2014the signs of the lifelong dreariness that was to follow it. Looking at the little trinkets which she had once eyed and fingered so fondly as the earnest of her future paradise of finery, she lived back in the moments when they had been given to her with such tender caresses, such strangely pretty words, such glowing looks, which filled her with a bewildering delicious surprise\u2014they were so much sweeter than she had thought anything could be. And the Arthur who had spoken to her and looked at her in this way, who was present with her now\u2014whose arm she felt round her, his cheek against hers, his very breath upon her\u2014was the cruel, cruel Arthur who had written that letter, that letter which she snatched and crushed and then opened again, that she might read it once more. The half-benumbed mental condition which was the effect of the last night\u2019s violent crying made it necessary to her to look again and see if her wretched thoughts were actually true\u2014if the letter was really so cruel. She had to hold it close to the window, else she could not have read it by the faint light. Yes! It was worse\u2014it was more cruel. She crushed it up again in anger. She hated the writer of that letter\u2014hated him for the very reason that she hung upon him with all her love\u2014all the girlish passion and vanity that made up her love. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  She had no tears this morning. She had wept them all away last night, and now she felt that dry-eyed morning misery, which is worse than the first shock because it has the future in it as well as the present. Every morning to come, as far as her imagination could stretch, she would have to get up and feel that the day would have no joy for her. For there is no despair so absolute as that which comes with the first moments of our first great sorrow, when we have not yet known what it is to have suffered and be healed, to have despaired and to have recovered hope. As Hetty began languidly to take off the clothes she had worn all the night, that she might wash herself and brush her hair, she had a sickening sense that her life would go on in this way. She should always be doing things she had no pleasure in, getting up to the old tasks of work, seeing people she cared nothing about, going to church, and to Treddleston, and to tea with Mrs. Best, and carrying no happy thought with her. For her short poisonous delights had spoiled for ever all the little joys that had once made the sweetness of her life\u2014the new frock ready for Treddleston Fair, the party at Mr. Britton\u2019s at Broxton wake, the beaux that she would say \u201cNo\u201d to for a long while, and the prospect of the wedding that was to come at last when she would have a silk gown and a great many clothes all at once. These things were all flat and dreary to her now; everything would be a weariness, and she would carry about for ever a hopeless thirst and longing. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  She paused in the midst of her languid undressing and leaned against the dark old clothes-press. Her neck and arms were bare, her hair hung down in delicate rings\u2014and they were just as beautiful as they were that night two months ago, when she walked up and down this bed-chamber glowing with vanity and hope. She was not thinking of her neck and arms now; even her own beauty was indifferent to her. Her eyes wandered sadly over the dull old chamber, and then looked out vacantly towards the growing dawn. Did a remembrance of Dinah come across her mind? Of her foreboding words, which had made her angry? Of Dinah\u2019s affectionate entreaty to think of her as a friend in trouble? No, the impression had been too slight to recur. Any affection or comfort Dinah could have given her would have been as indifferent to Hetty this morning as everything else was except her bruised passion. She was only thinking she could never stay here and go on with the old life\u2014she could better bear something quite new than sinking back into the old everyday round. She would like to run away that very morning, and never see any of the old faces again. But Hetty\u2019s was not a nature to face difficulties\u2014to dare to loose her hold on the familiar and rush blindly on some unknown condition. Hers was a luxurious and vain nature\u2014not a passionate one\u2014and if she were ever to take any violent measure, she must be urged to it by the desperation of terror. There was not much room for her thoughts to travel in the narrow circle of her imagination, and she soon fixed on the one thing she would do to get away from her old life: she would ask her uncle to let her go to be a lady\u2019s maid. Miss Lydia\u2019s maid would help her to get a situation, if she knew Hetty had her uncle\u2019s leave. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  When she had thought of this, she fastened up her hair and began to wash: it seemed more possible to her to go downstairs and try to behave as usual. She would ask her uncle this very day. On Hetty\u2019s blooming health it would take a great deal of such mental suffering as hers to leave any deep impress; and when she was dressed as neatly as usual in her working-dress, with her hair tucked up under her little cap, an indifferent observer would have been more struck with the young roundness of her cheek and neck and the darkness of her eyes and eyelashes than with any signs of sadness about her. But when she took up the crushed letter and put it in her drawer, that she might lock it out of sight, hard smarting tears, having no relief in them as the great drops had that fell last night, forced their way into her eyes. She wiped them away quickly: she must not cry in the day-time. Nobody should find out how miserable she was, nobody should know she was disappointed about anything; and the thought that the eyes of her aunt and uncle would be upon her gave her the self-command which often accompanies a great dread. For Hetty looked out from her secret misery towards the possibility of their ever knowing what had happened, as the sick and weary prisoner might think of the possible pillory. They would think her conduct shameful, and shame was torture. That was poor little Hetty\u2019s conscience. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  So she locked up her drawer and went away to her early work. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  In the evening, when Mr. Poyser was smoking his pipe, and his good-nature was therefore at its superlative moment, Hetty seized the opportunity of her aunt\u2019s absence to say, \u201cUncle, I wish you\u2019d let me go for a lady\u2019s maid.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr. Poyser took the pipe from his mouth and looked at Hetty in mild surprise for some moments.

She\u2019s looked like it o\u2019 late.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cEh, there\u2019s no knowing what she\u2019s got a liking to, for things take no more hold on her than if she was a dried pea. I believe that gell, Molly\u2014as is aggravatin\u2019 enough, for the matter o\u2019 that\u2014but I believe she\u2019d care more about leaving us and the children, for all she\u2019s been here but a year come Michaelmas, nor Hetty would. But she\u2019s got this notion o\u2019 being a lady\u2019s maid wi\u2019 going among them servants\u2014we might ha\u2019 known what it \u2019ud lead to when we let her go to learn the fine work.

Yes, I\u2019m fonder on her nor she deserves\u2014a little hard-hearted hussy, wanting to leave us i\u2019 that way. I can\u2019t ha\u2019 had her about me these seven year, I reckon, and done for her, and taught her everything wi\u2019out caring about her. An\u2019 here I\u2019m having linen spun, an\u2019 thinking all the while it\u2019ll make sheeting and table-clothing for her when she\u2019s married, an\u2019 she\u2019ll live i\u2019 the parish wi\u2019 us, and never go out of our sights\u2014like a fool as I am for thinking aught about her, as is no better nor a cherry wi\u2019 a hard stone inside it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, nay, thee mustna make much of a trifle,\u201d said Mr. Poyser, soothingly. \u201cShe\u2019s fond on us, I\u2019ll be bound; but she\u2019s young, an\u2019 gets things in her head as she can\u2019t rightly give account on. Them young fillies \u2019ull run away often wi\u2019out knowing why.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Her uncle\u2019s answers, however, had had another effect on Hetty besides that of disappointing her and making her cry. She knew quite well whom he had in his mind in his allusions to marriage, and to a sober, solid husband; and when she was in her bedroom again, the possibility of her marrying Adam presented itself to her in a new light. In a mind where no strong sympathies are at work, where there is no supreme sense of right to which the agitated nature can cling and steady itself to quiet endurance, one of the first results of sorrow is a desperate vague clutching after any deed that will change the actual condition. Poor Hetty\u2019s vision of consequences, at no time more than a narrow fantastic calculation of her own probable pleasures and pains, was now quite shut out by reckless irritation under present suffering, and she was ready for one of those convulsive, motiveless actions by which wretched men and women leap from a temporary sorrow into a lifelong misery. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Why should she not marry Adam? She did not care what she did, so that it made some change in her life. She felt confident that he would still want to marry her, and any further thought about Adam\u2019s happiness in the matter had never yet visited her.

It was the sort of a room a man prepares for himself when he feels sure of a long and respectable future.

You were generous enough to sacrifice that prospect in favor of a fellow-prisoner, of about your own age and figure, who had more pressing reasons than yourself for wishing to be on this side of the water. You exchanged dress, luggage, and names with him, and he passed to England instead of you as Henry Scaddon. Almost immediately afterward you escaped from your imprisonment, after feigning an illness which prevented your exchange of names from being discovered; and it was reported that you--that is, you under the name of your fellow-prisoner--were drowned in an open boat, trying to reach a Neapolitan vessel bound for Malta.

Those which might be avowed with impunity were not always to be distinguished as innocent by comparison with those which it was advisable to conceal.

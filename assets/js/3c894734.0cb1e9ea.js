They had expected Hetty to stay away a week or ten days at least, perhaps a little longer if Dinah came back with her, because there might then be something to detain them at Snowfield. But when a fortnight had passed they began to feel a little surprise that Hetty did not return; she must surely have found it pleasanter to be with Dinah than any one could have supposed. Adam, for his part, was getting very impatient to see her, and he resolved that, if she did not appear the next day (Saturday), he would set out on Sunday morning to fetch her. There was no coach on a Sunday, but by setting out before it was light, and perhaps getting a lift in a cart by the way, he would arrive pretty early at Snowfield, and bring back Hetty the next day\u2014Dinah too, if she were coming. It was quite time Hetty came home, and he would afford to lose his Monday for the sake of bringing her. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  His project was quite approved at the Farm when he went there on Saturday evening. Mrs. Poyser desired him emphatically not to come back without Hetty, for she had been quite too long away, considering the things she had to get ready by the middle of March, and a week was surely enough for any one to go out for their health. As for Dinah, Mrs. Poyser had small hope of their bringing her, unless they could make her believe the folks at Hayslope were twice as miserable as the folks at Snowfield. \u201cThough,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser, by way of conclusion, \u201cyou might tell her she\u2019s got but one aunt left, and ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"she\u2019s")," wasted pretty nigh to a shadder; and we shall p\u2019rhaps all be gone twenty mile farther off her next Michaelmas, and shall die o\u2019 broken hearts among strange folks, and leave the children fatherless and motherless.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, nay,\u201d said Mr. Poyser, who certainly had the air of a man perfectly heart-whole, \u201cit isna so bad as that.

But I\u2019d be glad for Dinah t\u2019 come, for she\u2019d help thee wi\u2019 the little uns: they took t\u2019 her wonderful.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  So at daybreak, on Sunday, Adam set off. Seth went with him the first mile or two, for the thought of Snowfield and the possibility that Dinah might come again made him restless, and the walk with Adam in the cold morning air, both in their best clothes, helped to give him a sense of Sunday calm. It was the last morning in February, with a low grey sky, and a slight hoar-frost on the green border of the road and on the black hedges. They heard the gurgling of the full brooklet hurrying down the hill, and the faint twittering of the early birds. For they walked in silence, though with a pleased sense of companionship. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGood-bye, lad,\u201d said Adam, laying his hand on Seth\u2019s shoulder and looking at him affectionately as they were about to part. \u201cI wish thee wast going all the way wi\u2019 me, and as happy as I am.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m content, Addy, I\u2019m content,\u201d said Seth cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ll be an old bachelor, belike, and make a fuss wi\u2019 thy children.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  They turned away from each other, and Seth walked leisurely homeward, mentally repeating one of his favourite hymns\u2014he was very fond of hymns: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDark and cheerless is the morn     Unaccompanied by thee: Joyless is the day\u2019s return     Till thy mercy\u2019s beams I see: Till thou inward light impart, Glad my eyes and warm my heart. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Visit, then, this soul of mine,     Pierce the gloom of sin and grief\u2014 Fill me, Radiancy Divine,     Scatter all my unbelief. More and more thyself display, Shining to the perfect day.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam walked much faster, and any one coming along the Oakbourne road at sunrise that morning must have had a pleasant sight in this tall broad-chested man, striding along with a carriage as upright and firm as any soldier\u2019s, glancing with keen glad eyes at the dark-blue hills as they began to show themselves on his way. Seldom in Adam\u2019s life had his face been so free from any cloud of anxiety as it was this morning; and this freedom from care, as is usual with constructive practical minds like his, made him all the more observant of the objects round him and all the more ready to gather suggestions from them towards his own favourite plans and ingenious contrivances. His happy love\u2014the knowledge that his steps were carrying him nearer and nearer to Hetty, who was so soon to be his\u2014was to his thoughts what the sweet morning air was to his sensations: it gave him a consciousness of well-being that made activity delightful. Every now and then there was a rush of more intense feeling towards her, which chased away other images than Hetty; and along with that would come a wondering thankfulness that all this happiness was given to him\u2014that this life of ours had such sweetness in it. For Adam had a devout mind, though he was perhaps rather impatient of devout words, and his tenderness lay very close to his reverence, so that the one could hardly be stirred without the other. But after feeling had welled up and poured itself out in this way, busy thought would come back with the greater vigour; and this morning it was intent on schemes by which the roads might be improved that were so imperfect all through the country, and on picturing all the benefits that might come from the exertions of a single country gentleman, if he would set himself to getting the roads made good in his own district. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It seemed a very short walk, the ten miles to Oakbourne, that pretty town within sight of the blue hills, where he break-fasted. After this, the country grew barer and barer: no more rolling woods, no more wide-branching trees near frequent homesteads, no more bushy hedgerows, but greystone walls intersecting the meagre pastures, and dismal wide-scattered greystone houses on broken lands where mines had been and were no longer. \u201cA hungry land,\u201d said Adam to himself. \u201cI\u2019d rather go south\u2019ard, where they say it\u2019s as flat as a table, than come to live here; though if Dinah likes to live in a country where she can be the most comfort to folks, she\u2019s i\u2019 the right to live o\u2019 this side; for she must look as if she\u2019d come straight from heaven, like th\u2019 angels in the desert, to strengthen them as ha\u2019 got nothing t\u2019 eat.\u201d And when at last he came in sight of Snowfield, he thought it looked like a town that was \u201cfellow to the country,\u201d though the stream through the valley where the great mill stood gave a pleasant greenness to the lower fields. The town lay, grim, stony, and unsheltered, up the side of a steep hill, and Adam did not go forward to it at present, for Seth had told him where to find Dinah. It was at a thatched cottage outside the town, a little way from the mill\u2014an old cottage, standing sideways towards the road, with a little bit of potato-ground before it. Here Dinah lodged with an elderly couple; and if she and Hetty happened to be out, Adam could learn where they were gone, or when they would be at home again. Dinah might be out on some preaching errand, and perhaps she would have left Hetty at home. Adam could not help hoping this, and as he recognized the cottage by the roadside before him, there shone out in his face that involuntary smile which belongs to the expectation of a near joy. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He hurried his step along the narrow causeway, and rapped at the door. It was opened by a very clean old woman, with a slow palsied shake of the head. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIs Dinah Morris at home?\u201d said Adam. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cEh?... no,\u201d said the old woman, looking up at this tall stranger with a wonder that made her slower of speech than usual. \u201cWill you please to come in?\u201d she added, retiring from the door, as if recollecting herself. \u201cWhy, ye\u2019re brother to the young man as come afore, arena ye?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Adam, entering. \u201cThat was Seth Bede.

My man isna come home from meeting.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam sat down patiently, not liking to hurry the shaking old woman with questions, but looking eagerly towards the narrow twisting stairs in one corner, for he thought it was possible Hetty might have heard his voice and would come down them. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSo you\u2019re come to see Dinah Morris?\u201d said the old woman, standing opposite to him. \u201cAn\u2019 you didn\u2019 know she was away from home, then?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo,\u201d said Adam, \u201cbut I thought it likely she might be away, seeing as it\u2019s Sunday. But the other young woman\u2014is she at home, or gone along with Dinah?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The old woman looked at Adam with a bewildered air. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGone along wi\u2019 her?\u201d she said. \u201cEh, Dinah\u2019s gone to Leeds, a big town ye may ha\u2019 heared on, where there\u2019s a many o\u2019 the Lord\u2019s people. She\u2019s been gone sin\u2019 Friday was a fortnight: they sent her the money for her journey. You may see her room here,\u201d she went on, opening a door and not noticing the effect of her words on Adam. He rose and followed her, and darted an eager glance into the little room with its narrow bed, the portrait of Wesley on the wall, and the few books lying on the large Bible. He had had an irrational hope that Hetty might be there. He could not speak in the first moment after seeing that the room was empty; an undefined fear had seized him\u2014something had happened to Hetty on the journey. Still the old woman was so slow of speech and apprehension, that Hetty might be at Snowfield after all. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s a pity ye didna know,\u201d she said. \u201cHave ye come from your own country o\u2019 purpose to see her?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut Hetty\u2014Hetty Sorrel,\u201d said Adam, abruptly; \u201cWhere is ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"she?"),"\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI know nobody by that name,\u201d said the old woman, wonderingly. \u201cIs it anybody ye\u2019ve heared on at Snowfield?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDid there come no young woman here\u2014very young and pretty\u2014Friday was a fortnight, to see Dinah Morris?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay; I\u2019n seen no young woman.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThink; are you quite sure?

Eh dear, eh dear, is there summat the matter?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The old woman had seen the ghastly look of fear in Adam\u2019s face. But he was not stunned or confounded: he was thinking eagerly where he could inquire about Hetty. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes; a young woman started from our country to see Dinah, Friday was a fortnight. I came to fetch her back. I\u2019m afraid something has happened to her. I can\u2019t stop. Good-bye.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He hastened out of the cottage, and the old woman followed him to the gate, watching him sadly with her shaking head as he almost ran towards the town. He was going to inquire at the place where the Oakbourne coach stopped. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  No! No young woman like Hetty had been seen there. Had any accident happened to the coach a fortnight ago? No. And there was no coach to take him back to Oakbourne that day. Well, he would walk: he couldn\u2019t stay here, in wretched inaction. But the innkeeper, seeing that Adam was in great anxiety, and entering into this new incident with the eagerness of a man who passes a great deal of time with his hands in his pockets looking into an obstinately monotonous street, offered to take him back to Oakbourne in his own \u201ctaxed cart\u201d this very evening. It was not five o\u2019clock; there was plenty of time for Adam to take a meal and yet to get to Oakbourne before ten o\u2019clock. The innkeeper declared that he really wanted to go to Oakbourne, and might as well go to-night; he should have all Monday before him then. Adam, after making an ineffectual attempt to eat, put the food in his pocket, and, drinking a draught of ale, declared himself ready to set off. As they approached the cottage, it occurred to him that he would do well to learn from the old woman where Dinah was to be found in Leeds: if there was trouble at the Hall Farm\u2014he only half-admitted the foreboding that there would be\u2014the Poysers might like to send for Dinah. But Dinah had not left any address, and the old woman, whose memory for names was infirm, could not recall the name of the \u201cblessed woman\u201d who was Dinah\u2019s chief friend in the Society at Leeds. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  During that long, long journey in the taxed cart, there was time for all the conjectures of importunate fear and struggling hope. In the very first shock of discovering that Hetty had not been to Snowfield, the thought of Arthur had darted through Adam like a sharp pang, but he tried for some time to ward off its return by busying himself with modes of accounting for the alarming fact, quite apart from that intolerable thought. Some accident had happened. Hetty had, by some strange chance, got into a wrong vehicle from Oakbourne: she had been taken ill, and did not want to frighten them by letting them know. But this frail fence of vague improbabilities was soon hurled down by a rush of distinct agonizing fears. Hetty had been deceiving herself in thinking that she could love and marry him: she had been loving Arthur all the while; and now, in her desperation at the nearness of their marriage, she had run away. And she was gone to ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"him"),". The old indignation and jealousy rose again, and prompted the suspicion that Arthur had been dealing falsely\u2014had written to Hetty\u2014had tempted her to come to him\u2014being unwilling, after all, that she should belong to another man besides himself. Perhaps the whole thing had been contrived by him, and he had given her directions how to follow him to Ireland\u2014for Adam knew that Arthur had been gone thither three weeks ago, having recently learnt it at the Chase. Every sad look of Hetty\u2019s, since she had been engaged to Adam, returned upon him now with all the exaggeration of painful retrospect. He had been foolishly sanguine and confident. The poor thing hadn\u2019t perhaps known her own mind for a long while; had thought that she could forget Arthur; had been momentarily drawn towards the man who offered her a protecting, faithful love. He couldn\u2019t bear to blame her: she never meant to cause him this dreadful pain. The blame lay with that man who had selfishly played with her heart\u2014had perhaps even deliberately lured her away. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  At Oakbourne, the ostler at the Royal Oak remembered such a young woman as Adam described getting out of the Treddleston coach more than a fortnight ago\u2014wasn\u2019t likely to forget such a pretty lass as that in a hurry\u2014was sure she had not gone on by the Buxton coach that went through Snowfield, but had lost sight of her while he went away with the horses and had never set eyes on her again. Adam then went straight to the house from which the Stoniton coach started: Stoniton was the most obvious place for Hetty to go to first, whatever might be her destination, for she would hardly venture on any but the chief coach-roads. She had been noticed here too, and was remembered to have sat on the box by the coachman; but the coachman could not be seen, for another man had been driving on that road in his stead the last three or four days. He could probably be seen at Stoniton, through inquiry at the inn where the coach put up. So the anxious heart-stricken Adam must of necessity wait and try to rest till morning\u2014nay, till eleven o\u2019clock, when the coach started. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  At Stoniton another delay occurred, for the old coachman who had driven Hetty would not be in the town again till night. When he did come he remembered Hetty well, and remembered his own joke addressed to her, quoting it many times to Adam, and observing with equal frequency that he thought there was something more than common, because Hetty had not laughed when he joked her. But he declared, as the people had done at the inn, that he had lost sight of Hetty directly she got down. Part of the next morning was consumed in inquiries at every house in the town from which a coach started\u2014(all in vain, for you know Hetty did not start from Stoniton by coach, but on foot in the grey morning)\u2014and then in walking out to the first toll-gates on the different lines of road, in the forlorn hope of finding some recollection of her there. No, she was not to be traced any farther; and the next hard task for Adam was to go home and carry the wretched tidings to the Hall Farm. As to what he should do beyond that, he had come to two distinct resolutions amidst the tumult of thought and feeling which was going on within him while he went to and fro. He would not mention what he knew of Arthur Donnithorne\u2019s behaviour to Hetty till there was a clear necessity for it: it was still possible Hetty might come back, and the disclosure might be an injury or an offence to her. And as soon as he had been home and done what was necessary there to prepare for his further absence, he would start off to Ireland: if he found no trace of Hetty on the road, he would go straight to Arthur Donnithorne and make himself certain how far he was acquainted with her movements. Several times the thought occurred to him that he would consult Mr. Irwine, but that would be useless unless he told him all, and so betrayed the secret about Arthur. It seems strange that Adam, in the incessant occupation of his mind about Hetty, should never have alighted on the probability that she had gone to Windsor, ignorant that Arthur was no longer there. Perhaps the reason was that he could not conceive Hetty\u2019s throwing herself on Arthur uncalled; he imagined no cause that could have driven her to such a step, after that letter written in August. There were but two alternatives in his mind: either Arthur had written to her again and enticed her away, or she had simply fled from her approaching marriage with himself because she found, after all, she could not love him well enough, and yet was afraid of her friends\u2019 anger if she retracted. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  With this last determination on his mind, of going straight to Arthur, the thought that he had spent two days in inquiries which had proved to be almost useless, was torturing to Adam; and yet, since he would not tell the Poysers his conviction as to where Hetty was gone, or his intention to follow her thither, he must be able to say to them that he had traced her as far as possible. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It was after twelve o\u2019clock on Tuesday night when Adam reached Treddleston; and, unwilling to disturb his mother and Seth, and also to encounter their questions at that hour, he threw himself without undressing on a bed at the \u201cWaggon Overthrown,\u201d and slept hard from pure weariness. Not more than four hours, however, for before five o\u2019clock he set out on his way home in the faint morning twilight. He always kept a key of the workshop door in his pocket, so that he could let himself in; and he wished to enter without awaking his mother, for he was anxious to avoid telling her the new trouble himself by seeing Seth first, and asking him to tell her when it should be necessary. He walked gently along the yard, and turned the key gently in the door; but, as he expected, Gyp, who lay in the workshop, gave a sharp bark. It subsided when he saw Adam, holding up his finger at him to impose silence, and in his dumb, tailless joy he must content himself with rubbing his body against his master\u2019s legs. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam was too heart-sick to take notice of Gyp\u2019s fondling. He threw himself on the bench and stared dully at the wood and the signs of work around him, wondering if he should ever come to feel pleasure in them again, while Gyp, dimly aware that there was something wrong with his master, laid his rough grey head on Adam\u2019s knee and wrinkled his brows to look up at him. Hitherto, since Sunday afternoon, Adam had been constantly among strange people and in strange places, having no associations with the details of his daily life, and now that by the light of this new morning he was come back to his home and surrounded by the familiar objects that seemed for ever robbed of their charm, the reality\u2014the hard, inevitable reality of his troubles pressed upon him with a new weight. Right before him was an unfinished chest of drawers, which he had been making in spare moments for Hetty\u2019s use, when his home should be hers. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Seth had not heard Adam\u2019s entrance, but he had been roused by Gyp\u2019s bark, and Adam heard him moving about in the room above, dressing himself. Seth\u2019s first thoughts were about his brother: he would come home to-day, surely, for the business would be wanting him sadly by to-morrow, but it was pleasant to think he had had a longer holiday than he had expected. And would Dinah come too? Seth felt that that was the greatest happiness he could look forward to for himself, though he had no hope left that she would ever love him well enough to marry him; but he had often said to himself, it was better to be Dinah\u2019s friend and brother than any other woman\u2019s husband. If he could but be always near her, instead of living so far off! "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He came downstairs and opened the inner door leading from the kitchen into the workshop, intending to let out Gyp; but he stood still in the doorway, smitten with a sudden shock at the sight of Adam seated listlessly on the bench, pale, unwashed, with sunken blank eyes, almost like a drunkard in the morning. But Seth felt in an instant what the marks meant\u2014not drunkenness, but some great calamity. Adam looked up at him without speaking, and Seth moved forward towards the bench, himself trembling so that speech did not come readily. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGod have mercy on us, Addy,\u201d he said, in a low voice, sitting down on the bench beside Adam, \u201cwhat is it?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam was unable to speak. The strong man, accustomed to suppress the signs of sorrow, had felt his heart swell like a child\u2019s at this first approach of sympathy. He fell on Seth\u2019s neck and sobbed. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Seth was prepared for the worst now, for, even in his recollections of their boyhood, Adam had never sobbed before. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIs it death, Adam? Is she dead?\u201d he asked, in a low tone, when Adam raised his head and was recovering himself. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, lad; but she\u2019s gone\u2014gone away from us. She\u2019s never been to Snowfield. Dinah\u2019s been gone to Leeds ever since last Friday was a fortnight, the very day Hetty set out. I can\u2019t find out where she went after she got to Stoniton.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Seth was silent from utter astonishment: he knew nothing that could suggest to him a reason for Hetty\u2019s going away. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHast any notion what she\u2019s done it for?\u201d he said, at last. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cShe can\u2019t ha\u2019 loved me. She didn\u2019t like our marriage when it came nigh\u2014that must be it,\u201d said Adam. He had determined to mention no further reason. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI hear Mother stirring,\u201d said Seth. \u201cMust we tell her?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, not yet,\u201d said Adam, rising from the bench and pushing the hair from his face, as if he wanted to rouse himself. \u201cI can\u2019t have her told yet; and I must set out on another journey directly, after I\u2019ve been to the village and th\u2019 Hall Farm. I can\u2019t tell thee where I\u2019m going, and thee must say to her I\u2019m gone on business as nobody is to know anything about. I\u2019ll go and wash myself now.\u201d Adam moved towards the door of the workshop, but after a step or two he turned round, and, meeting Seth\u2019s eyes with a calm sad glance, he said, \u201cI must take all the money out o\u2019 the tin box, lad; but if anything happens to me, all the rest \u2019ll be thine, to take care o\u2019 Mother with.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Seth was pale and trembling: he felt there was some terrible secret under all this. \u201cBrother,\u201d he said, faintly\u2014he never called Adam \u201cBrother\u201d except in solemn moments\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll do anything as you can\u2019t ask God\u2019s blessing on.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, lad,\u201d said Adam, \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m for doing nought but what\u2019s a man\u2019s duty.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The thought that if he betrayed his trouble to his mother, she would only distress him by words, half of blundering affection, half of irrepressible triumph that Hetty proved as unfit to be his wife as she had always foreseen, brought back some of his habitual firmness and self-command. He had felt ill on his journey home\u2014he told her when she came down\u2014had stayed all night at Tredddleston for that reason; and a bad headache, that still hung about him this morning, accounted for his paleness and heavy eyes. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He determined to go to the village, in the first place, attend to his business for an hour, and give notice to Burge of his being obliged to go on a journey, which he must beg him not to mention to any one; for he wished to avoid going to the Hall Farm near breakfast-time, when the children and servants would be in the house-place, and there must be exclamations in their hearing about his having returned without Hetty. He waited until the clock struck nine before he left the work-yard at the village, and set off, through the fields, towards the Farm. It was an immense relief to him, as he came near the Home Close, to see Mr. Poyser advancing towards him, for this would spare him the pain of going to the house. Mr. Poyser was walking briskly this March morning, with a sense of spring business on his mind: he was going to cast the master\u2019s eye on the shoeing of a new cart-horse, carrying his spud as a useful companion by the way. His surprise was great when he caught sight of Adam, but he was not a man given to presentiments of evil. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, Adam, lad, is\u2019t you? Have ye been all this time away and not brought the lasses back, after all? Where are they?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, I\u2019ve not brought \u2019em,\u201d said Adam, turning round, to indicate that he wished to walk back with Mr. Poyser. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy,\u201d said Martin, looking with sharper attention at Adam, \u201cye look bad. Is there anything happened?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Adam, heavily. \u201cA sad thing\u2019s happened. I didna find Hetty at Snowfield.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr. Poyser\u2019s good-natured face showed signs of troubled astonishment. \u201cNot find her? What\u2019s happened to her?\u201d he said, his thoughts flying at once to bodily accident. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat I can\u2019t tell, whether anything\u2019s happened to her. She never went to Snowfield\u2014she took the coach to Stoniton, but I can\u2019t learn nothing of her after she got down from the Stoniton coach.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, you donna mean she\u2019s run away?\u201d said Martin, standing still, so puzzled and bewildered that the fact did not yet make itself felt as a trouble by him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cShe must ha\u2019 done,\u201d said Adam. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like our marriage when it came to the point\u2014that must be it. She\u2019d mistook her feelings.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Martin was silent for a minute or two, looking on the ground and rooting up the grass with his spud, without knowing what he was doing. His usual slowness was always trebled when the subject of speech was painful. At last he looked up, right in Adam\u2019s face, saying, \u201cThen she didna deserve t\u2019 ha\u2019 ye, my lad. An\u2019 I feel i\u2019 fault myself, for she was my niece, and I was allays hot for her marr\u2019ing ye. There\u2019s no amends I can make ye, lad\u2014the more\u2019s the pity: it\u2019s a sad cut-up for ye, I doubt.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam could say nothing; and Mr. Poyser, after pursuing his walk for a little while, went on, \u201cI\u2019ll be bound she\u2019s gone after trying to get a lady\u2019s maid\u2019s place, for she\u2019d got that in her head half a year ago, and wanted me to gi\u2019 my consent. But I\u2019d thought better on her\u201d\u2014he added, shaking his head slowly and sadly\u2014\u201cI\u2019d thought better on her, nor to look for this, after she\u2019d gi\u2019en y\u2019 her word, an\u2019 everything been got ready.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam had the strongest motives for encouraging this supposition in Mr. Poyser, and he even tried to believe that it might possibly be true. He had no warrant for the ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"certainty")," that she was gone to Arthur. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt was better it should be so,\u201d he said, as quietly as he could, \u201cif she felt she couldn\u2019t like me for a husband. Better run away before than repent after. I hope you won\u2019t look harshly on her if she comes back, as she may do if she finds it hard to get on away from home.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI canna look on her as I\u2019ve done before,\u201d said Martin decisively. \u201cShe\u2019s acted bad by you, and by all of us. But I\u2019ll not turn my back on her: she\u2019s but a young un, and it\u2019s the first harm I\u2019ve knowed on her. It\u2019ll be a hard job for me to tell her aunt. Why didna Dinah come back wi\u2019 ye? She\u2019d ha\u2019 helped to pacify her aunt a bit.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDinah wasn\u2019t at Snowfield.

We\u2019n no need to say why the match is broke off, an\u2019 we may hear of her after a bit. Shake hands wi\u2019 me, lad: I wish I could make thee amends.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There was something in Martin Poyser\u2019s throat at that moment which caused him to bring out those scanty words in rather a broken fashion. Yet Adam knew what they meant all the better, and the two honest men grasped each other\u2019s hard hands in mutual understanding. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There was nothing now to hinder Adam from setting off. He had told Seth to go to the Chase and leave a message for the squire, saying that Adam Bede had been obliged to start off suddenly on a journey\u2014and to say as much, and no more, to any one else who made inquiries about him. If the Poysers learned that he was gone away again, Adam knew they would infer that he was gone in search of Hetty. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He had intended to go right on his way from the Hall Farm, but now the impulse which had frequently visited him before\u2014to go to Mr. Irwine, and make a confidant of him\u2014recurred with the new force which belongs to a last opportunity. He was about to start on a long journey\u2014a difficult one\u2014by sea\u2014and no soul would know where he was gone. If anything happened to him? Or, if he absolutely needed help in any matter concerning Hetty? Mr. Irwine was to be trusted; and the feeling which made Adam shrink from telling anything which was ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her")," secret must give way before the need there was that she should have some one else besides himself who would be prepared to defend her in the worst extremity. Towards Arthur, even though he might have incurred no new guilt, Adam felt that he was not bound to keep silence when Hetty\u2019s interest called on him to speak. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI must do it,\u201d said Adam, when these thoughts, which had spread themselves through hours of his sad journeying, now rushed upon him in an instant, like a wave that had been slowly gathering; \u201cit\u2019s the right thing.

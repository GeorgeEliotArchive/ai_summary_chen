No wonder the patient beasts ran confusedly into the wrong places, for the alarming din of the bull-dog was mingled with more distant sounds which the timid feminine creatures, with pardonable superstition, imagined also to have some relation to their own movements\u2014with the tremendous crack of the waggoner\u2019s whip, the roar of his voice, and the booming thunder of the waggon, as it left the rick-yard empty of its golden load.

We mun be thankful for that, whether she stays or no. But I canna think what she mun leave a good home for, to go back int\u2019 a country where the land, most on\u2019t, isna worth ten shillings an acre, rent and profits.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, that\u2019s just the reason she wants to go, as fur as she can give a reason,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser. \u201cShe says this country\u2019s too comfortable, an\u2019 there\u2019s too much t\u2019 eat, an\u2019 folks arena miserable enough. And she\u2019s going next week. I canna turn her, say what I will. It\u2019s allays the way wi\u2019 them meek-faced people; you may\u2019s well pelt a bag o\u2019 feathers as talk to \u2019em. But I say it isna religion, to be so obstinate\u2014is it now, Adam?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam saw that Dinah was more disturbed than he had ever seen her by any matter relating to herself, and, anxious to relieve her, if possible, he said, looking at her affectionately, \u201cNay, I can\u2019t find fault with anything Dinah does. I believe her thoughts are better than our guesses, let \u2019em be what they may. I should ha\u2019 been thankful for her to stay among us, but if she thinks well to go, I wouldn\u2019t cross her, or make it hard to her by objecting. We owe her something different to that.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  As it often happens, the words intended to relieve her were just too much for Dinah\u2019s susceptible feelings at this moment. The tears came into the grey eyes too fast to be hidden and she got up hurriedly, meaning it to be understood that she was going to put on her bonnet. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMother, what\u2019s Dinah crying for?\u201d said Totty. \u201cShe isn\u2019t a naughty dell.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThee\u2019st gone a bit too fur,\u201d said Mr. Poyser. \u201cWe\u2019ve no right t\u2019 interfere with her doing as she likes. An\u2019 thee\u2019dst be as angry as could be wi\u2019 me, if I said a word against anything she did.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBecause you\u2019d very like be finding fault wi\u2019out reason,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser. \u201cBut there\u2019s reason i\u2019 what I say, else I shouldna say it. It\u2019s easy talking for them as can\u2019t love her so well as her own aunt does. An\u2019 me got so used to her! I shall feel as uneasy as a new sheared sheep when she\u2019s gone from me. An\u2019 to think of her leaving a parish where she\u2019s so looked on. There\u2019s Mr. Irwine makes as much of her as if she was a lady, for all her being a Methodist, an\u2019 wi\u2019 that maggot o\u2019 preaching in her head\u2014God forgi\u2019e me if I\u2019m i\u2019 the wrong to call it so.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAye,\u201d said Mr. Poyser, looking jocose; \u201cbut thee dostna tell Adam what he said to thee about it one day. The missis was saying, Adam, as the preaching was the only fault to be found wi\u2019 Dinah, and Mr. Irwine says, \u2018But you mustn\u2019t find fault with her for that, Mrs. Poyser; you forget she\u2019s got no husband to preach to. I\u2019ll answer for it, you give Poyser many a good sermon.\u2019 The parson had thee there,\u201d Mr. Poyser added, laughing unctuously. \u201cI told Bartle Massey on it, an\u2019 he laughed too.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, it\u2019s a small joke sets men laughing when they sit a-staring at one another with a pipe i\u2019 their mouths,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser. \u201cGive Bartle Massey his way and he\u2019d have all the sharpness to himself. If the chaff-cutter had the making of us, we should all be straw, I reckon. Totty, my chicken, go upstairs to cousin Dinah, and see what she\u2019s doing, and give her a pretty kiss.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  This errand was devised for Totty as a means of checking certain threatening symptoms about the corners of the mouth; for Tommy, no longer expectant of cake, was lifting up his eyelids with his forefingers and turning his eyeballs towards Totty in a way that she felt to be disagreeably personal. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019re rare and busy now\u2014eh, Adam?\u201d said Mr. Poyser. \u201cBurge\u2019s getting so bad wi\u2019 his asthmy, it\u2019s well if he\u2019ll ever do much riding about again.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, we\u2019ve got a pretty bit o\u2019 building on hand now,\u201d said Adam, \u201cwhat with the repairs on th\u2019 estate, and the new houses at Treddles\u2019on.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ll bet a penny that new house Burge is building on his own bit o\u2019 land is for him and Mary to go to,\u201d said Mr. Poyser. \u201cHe\u2019ll be for laying by business soon, I\u2019ll warrant, and be wanting you to take to it all and pay him so much by th\u2019 \u2019ear. We shall see you living on th\u2019 hill before another twelvemont\u2019s over.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d said Adam, \u201cI should like t\u2019 have the business in my own hands. It isn\u2019t as I mind much about getting any more money. We\u2019ve enough and to spare now, with only our two selves and mother; but I should like t\u2019 have my own way about things\u2014I could try plans then, as I can\u2019t do now.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou get on pretty well wi\u2019 the new steward, I reckon?\u201d said Mr. Poyser. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, yes; he\u2019s a sensible man enough; understands farming\u2014he\u2019s carrying on the draining, and all that, capital. You must go some day towards the Stonyshire side and see what alterations they\u2019re making. But he\u2019s got no notion about buildings. You can so seldom get hold of a man as can turn his brains to more nor one thing; it\u2019s just as if they wore blinkers like th\u2019 horses and could see nothing o\u2019 one side of \u2019em. Now, there\u2019s Mr. Irwine has got notions o\u2019 building more nor most architects; for as for th\u2019 architects, they set up to be fine fellows, but the most of \u2019em don\u2019t know where to set a chimney so as it shan\u2019t be quarrelling with a door. My notion is, a practical builder that\u2019s got a bit o\u2019 taste makes the best architect for common things; and I\u2019ve ten times the pleasure i\u2019 seeing after the work when I\u2019ve made the plan myself.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr. Poyser listened with an admiring interest to Adam\u2019s discourse on building, but perhaps it suggested to him that the building of his corn-rick had been proceeding a little too long without the control of the master\u2019s eye, for when Adam had done speaking, he got up and said, \u201cWell, lad, I\u2019ll bid you good-bye now, for I\u2019m off to the rick-yard again.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam rose too, for he saw Dinah entering, with her bonnet on and a little basket in her hand, preceded by Totty. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou\u2019re ready, I see, Dinah,\u201d Adam said; \u201cso we\u2019ll set off, for the sooner I\u2019m at home the better.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMother,\u201d said Totty, with her treble pipe, \u201cDinah was saying her prayers and crying ever so.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHush, hush,\u201d said the mother, \u201clittle gells mustn\u2019t chatter.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Whereupon the father, shaking with silent laughter, set Totty on the white deal table and desired her to kiss him. Mr. and Mrs. Poyser, you perceive, had no correct principles of education. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCome back to-morrow if Mrs. Bede doesn\u2019t want you, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser: \u201cbut you can stay, you know, if she\u2019s ill.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  So, when the good-byes had been said, Dinah and Adam left the Hall Farm together."))}y.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

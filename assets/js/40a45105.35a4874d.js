In her early letters to Tom she had always sent her love to Philip, and asked many questions about him, which were answered by brief sentences about Tom\u2019s toothache, and a turf-house which he was helping to build in the garden, with other items of that kind. She was pained to hear Tom say in the holidays that Philip was as queer as ever again, and often cross. They were no longer very good friends, she perceived; and when she reminded Tom that he ought always to love Philip for being so good to him when his foot was bad, he answered: \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t my fault; ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I")," don\u2019t do anything to him.\u201d She hardly ever saw Philip during the remainder of their school-life; in the Midsummer holidays he was always away at the seaside, and at Christmas she could only meet him at long intervals in the street of St Ogg\u2019s. When they did meet, she remembered her promise to kiss him, but, as a young lady who had been at a boarding-school, she knew now that such a greeting was out of the question, and Philip would not expect it. The promise was void, like so many other sweet, illusory promises of our childhood; void as promises made in Eden before the seasons were divided, and when the starry blossoms grew side by side with the ripening peach,\u2014impossible to be fulfilled when the golden gates had been passed. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But when their father was actually engaged in the long-threatened lawsuit, and Wakem, as the agent at once of Pivart and Old Harry, was acting against him, even Maggie felt, with some sadness, that they were not likely ever to have any intimacy with Philip again; the very name of Wakem made her father angry, and she had once heard him say that if that crook-backed son lived to inherit his father\u2019s ill-gotten gains, there would be a curse upon him. \u201cHave as little to do with him at school as you can, my lad,\u201d he said to Tom; and the command was obeyed the more easily because Mr Sterling by this time had two additional pupils; for though this gentleman\u2019s rise in the world was not of that meteor-like rapidity which the admirers of his extemporaneous eloquence had expected for a preacher whose voice demanded so wide a sphere, he had yet enough of growing prosperity to enable him to increase his expenditure in continued disproportion to his income. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  As for Tom\u2019s school course, it went on with mill-like monotony, his mind continuing to move with a slow, half-stifled pulse in a medium of uninteresting or unintelligible ideas. But each vacation he brought home larger and larger drawings with the satiny rendering of landscape, and water-colours in vivid greens, together with manuscript books full of exercises and problems, in which the handwriting was all the finer because he gave his whole mind to it. Each vacation he brought home a new book or two, indicating his progress through different stages of history, Christian doctrine, and Latin literature; and that passage was not entirely without results, besides the possession of the books. Tom\u2019s ear and tongue had become accustomed to a great many words and phrases which are understood to be signs of an educated condition; and though he had never really applied his mind to any one of his lessons, the lessons had left a deposit of vague, fragmentary, ineffectual notions. Mr Tulliver, seeing signs of acquirement beyond the reach of his own criticism, thought it was probably all right with Tom\u2019s education; he observed, indeed, that there were no maps, and not enough \u201csumming\u201d; but he made no formal complaint to Mr Stelling. It was a puzzling business, this schooling; and if he took Tom away, where could he send him with better effect? "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  By the time Tom had reached his last quarter at King\u2019s Lorton, the years had made striking changes in him since the day we saw him returning from Mr Jacobs\u2019s academy. He was a tall youth now, carrying himself without the least awkwardness, and speaking without more shyness than was a becoming symptom of blended diffidence and pride; he wore his tail-coat and his stand-up collars, and watched the down on his lip with eager impatience, looking every day at his virgin razor, with which he had provided himself in the last holidays. Philip had already left,\u2014at the autumn quarter,\u2014that he might go to the south for the winter, for the sake of his health; and this change helped to give Tom the unsettled, exultant feeling that usually belongs to the last months before leaving school. This quarter, too, there was some hope of his father\u2019s lawsuit being decided; ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"that")," made the prospect of home more entirely pleasurable. For Tom, who had gathered his view of the case from his father\u2019s conversation, had no doubt that Pivart would be beaten. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom had not heard anything from home for some weeks,\u2014a fact which did not surprise him, for his father and mother were not apt to manifest their affection in unnecessary letters,\u2014when, to his great surprise, on the morning of a dark, cold day near the end of November, he was told, soon after entering the study at nine o\u2019clock, that his sister was in the drawing-room. It was Mrs Stelling who had come into the study to tell him, and she left him to enter the drawing-room alone. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie, too, was tall now, with braided and coiled hair; she was almost as tall as Tom, though she was only thirteen; and she really looked older than he did at that moment. She had thrown off her bonnet, her heavy braids were pushed back from her forehead, as if it would not bear that extra load, and her young face had a strangely worn look, as her eyes turned anxiously toward the door. When Tom entered she did not speak, but only went up to him, put her arms round his neck, and kissed him earnestly. He was used to various moods of hers, and felt no alarm at the unusual seriousness of her greeting. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, how is it you\u2019re come so early this cold morning, Maggie? Did you come in the gig?\u201d said Tom, as she backed toward the sofa, and drew him to her side. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, I came by the coach. I\u2019ve walked from the turnpike.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut how is it you\u2019re not at school? The holidays have not begun yet?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cFather wanted me at home,\u201d said Maggie, with a slight trembling of the lip. \u201cI came home three or four days ago.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIsn\u2019t my father well?\u201d said Tom, rather anxiously. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNot quite,\u201d said Maggie. \u201cHe\u2019s very unhappy, Tom. The lawsuit is ended, and I came to tell you because I thought it would be better for you to know it before you came home, and I didn\u2019t like only to send you a letter.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMy father hasn\u2019t lost?\u201d said Tom, hastily, springing from the sofa, and standing before Maggie with his hands suddenly thrust into his pockets. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, dear Tom,\u201d said Maggie, looking up at him with trembling. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom was silent a minute or two, with his eyes fixed on the floor. Then he said: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMy father will have to pay a good deal of money, then?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Maggie, rather faintly. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, it can\u2019t be helped,\u201d said Tom, bravely, not translating the loss of a large sum of money into any tangible results. \u201cBut my father\u2019s very much vexed, I dare say?\u201d he added, looking at Maggie, and thinking that her agitated face was only part of her girlish way of taking things. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Maggie, again faintly. Then, urged to fuller speech by Tom\u2019s freedom from apprehension, she said loudly and rapidly, as if the words ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"would")," burst from her: \u201cOh, Tom, he will lose the mill and the land and everything; he will have nothing left.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom\u2019s eyes flashed out one look of surprise at her, before he turned pale, and trembled visibly. He said nothing, but sat down on the sofa again, looking vaguely out of the opposite window. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Anxiety about the future had never entered Tom\u2019s mind. His father had always ridden a good horse, kept a good house, and had the cheerful, confident air of a man who has plenty of property to fall back upon. Tom had never dreamed that his father would \u201cfail\u201d; ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"that")," was a form of misfortune which he had always heard spoken of as a deep disgrace, and disgrace was an idea that he could not associate with any of his relations, least of all with his father. A proud sense of family respectability was part of the very air Tom had been born and brought up in. He knew there were people in St Ogg\u2019s who made a show without money to support it, and he had always heard such people spoken of by his own friends with contempt and reprobation. He had a strong belief, which was a lifelong habit, and required no definite evidence to rest on, that his father could spend a great deal of money if he chose; and since his education at Mr Stelling\u2019s had given him a more expensive view of life, he had often thought that when he got older he would make a figure in the world, with his horse and dogs and saddle, and other accoutrements of a fine young man, and show himself equal to any of his contemporaries at St Ogg\u2019s, who might consider themselves a grade above him in society because their fathers were professional men, or had large oil-mills. As to the prognostics and headshaking of his aunts and uncles, they had never produced the least effect on him, except to make him think that aunts and uncles were disagreeable society; he had heard them find fault in much the same way as long as he could remember. His father knew better than they did. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The down had come on Tom\u2019s lip, yet his thoughts and expectations had been hitherto only the reproduction, in changed forms, of the boyish dreams in which he had lived three years ago. He was awakened now with a violent shock. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie was frightened at Tom\u2019s pale, trembling silence. There was something else to tell him,\u2014something worse. She threw her arms round him at last, and said, with a half sob: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, Tom\u2014dear, dear Tom, don\u2019t fret too much; try and bear it well.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom turned his cheek passively to meet her entreating kisses, and there gathered a moisture in his eyes, which he just rubbed away with his hand. The action seemed to rouse him, for he shook himself and said: \u201cI shall go home, with you, Maggie. Didn\u2019t my father say I was to go?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, Tom, father didn\u2019t wish it,\u201d said Maggie, her anxiety about ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"his")," feeling helping her to master her agitation. What ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"would")," he do when she told him all? \u201cBut mother wants you to come,\u2014poor mother!\u2014she cries so. Oh, Tom, it\u2019s very dreadful at home.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie\u2019s lips grew whiter, and she began to tremble almost as Tom had done. The two poor things clung closer to each other, both trembling,\u2014the one at an unshapen fear, the other at the image of a terrible certainty. When Maggie spoke, it was hardly above a whisper. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd\u2014and\u2014poor father\u2014\u2014\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie could not utter it. But the suspense was intolerable to Tom. A vague idea of going to prison, as a consequence of debt, was the shape his fears had begun to take. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhere\u2019s my father?\u201d he said impatiently. \u201c",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Tell")," me, Maggie.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHe\u2019s at home,\u201d said Maggie, finding it easier to reply to that question. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, after a pause, \u201cnot himself\u2014he fell off his horse. He has known nobody but me ever since\u2014he seems to have lost his senses. O father, father\u2014\u2014\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  With these last words, Maggie\u2019s sobs burst forth with the more violence for the previous struggle against them. Tom felt that pressure of the heart which forbids tears; he had no distinct vision of their troubles as Maggie had, who had been at home; he only felt the crushing weight of what seemed unmitigated misfortune. He tightened his arm almost convulsively round Maggie as she sobbed, but his face looked rigid and tearless, his eyes blank,\u2014as if a black curtain of cloud had suddenly fallen on his path. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But Maggie soon checked herself abruptly; a single thought had acted on her like a startling sound. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWe must set out, Tom, we must not stay. Father will miss me; we must be at the turnpike at ten to meet the coach.\u201d She said this with hasty decision, rubbing her eyes, and rising to seize her bonnet. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom at once felt the same impulse, and rose too. \u201cWait a minute, Maggie,\u201d he said. \u201cI must speak to Mr Stelling, and then we\u2019ll go.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He thought he must go to the study where the pupils were; but on his way he met Mr Stelling, who had heard from his wife that Maggie appeared to be in trouble when she asked for her brother, and now that he thought the brother and sister had been alone long enough, was coming to inquire and offer his sympathy. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cPlease, sir, I must go home,\u201d Tom said abruptly, as he met Mr Stelling in the passage. \u201cI must go back with my sister directly. My father\u2019s lost his lawsuit\u2014he\u2019s lost all his property\u2014and he\u2019s very ill.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Stelling felt like a kind-hearted man; he foresaw a probable money loss for himself, but this had no appreciable share in his feeling, while he looked with grave pity at the brother and sister for whom youth and sorrow had begun together. When he knew how Maggie had come, and how eager she was to get home again, he hurried their departure, only whispering something to Mrs Stelling, who had followed him, and who immediately left the room. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom and Maggie were standing on the door-step, ready to set out, when Mrs Stelling came with a little basket, which she hung on Maggie\u2019s arm, saying: \u201cDo remember to eat something on the way, dear.\u201d Maggie\u2019s heart went out toward this woman whom she had never liked, and she kissed her silently. It was the first sign within the poor child of that new sense which is the gift of sorrow,\u2014that susceptibility to the bare offices of humanity which raises them into a bond of loving fellowship, as to haggard men among the ice-bergs the mere presence of an ordinary comrade stirs the deep fountains of affection. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Stelling put his hand on Tom\u2019s shoulder and said: \u201cGod bless you, my boy; let me know how you get on.\u201d Then he pressed Maggie\u2019s hand; but there were no audible good-byes. Tom had so often thought how joyful he should be the day he left school \u201cfor good\u201d! And now his school years seemed like a holiday that had come to an end. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The two slight youthful figures soon grew indistinct on the distant road,\u2014were soon lost behind the projecting hedgerow. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  They had gone forth together into their life of sorrow, and they would never more see the sunshine undimmed by remembered cares. They had entered the thorny wilderness, and the golden gates of their childhood had forever closed behind them."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

Since you\u2019re likely to have rather a smoky, unpleasant time of it at Newcastle for the next few weeks, you\u2019ll want a good prospect of some sort to keep up your spirits.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Tom waited less nervously than he had done on a former occasion in this apartment, while his uncle took out his snuff-box and gratified each nostril with deliberate impartiality. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou see, Tom,\u201d said Mr Deane at last, throwing himself backward, \u201cthe world goes on at a smarter pace now than it did when I was a young fellow. Why, sir, forty years ago, when I was much such a strapping youngster as you, a man expected to pull between the shafts the best part of his life, before he got the whip in his hand. The looms went slowish, and fashions didn\u2019t alter quite so fast; I\u2019d a best suit that lasted me six years. Everything was on a lower scale, sir,\u2014in point of expenditure, I mean. It\u2019s this steam, you see, that has made the difference; it drives on every wheel double pace, and the wheel of fortune along with \u2019em, as our Mr Stephen Guest said at the anniversary dinner (he hits these things off wonderfully, considering he\u2019s seen nothing of business). I don\u2019t find fault with the change, as some people do. Trade, sir, opens a man\u2019s eyes; and if the population is to get thicker upon the ground, as it\u2019s doing, the world must use its wits at inventions of one sort or other. I know I\u2019ve done my share as an ordinary man of business. Somebody has said it\u2019s a fine thing to make two ears of corn grow where only one grew before; but, sir, it\u2019s a fine thing, too, to further the exchange of commodities, and bring the grains of corn to the mouths that are hungry. And that\u2019s our line of business; and I consider it as honourable a position as a man can hold, to be connected with it.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Tom knew that the affair his uncle had to speak of was not urgent; Mr Deane was too shrewd and practical a man to allow either his reminiscences or his snuff to impede the progress of trade. Indeed, for the last month or two, there had been hints thrown out to Tom which enabled him to guess that he was going to hear some proposition for his own benefit. With the beginning of the last speech he had stretched out his legs, thrust his hands in his pockets, and prepared himself for some introductory diffuseness, tending to show that Mr Deane had succeeded by his own merit, and that what he had to say to young men in general was, that if they didn\u2019t succeed too it was because of their own demerit. He was rather surprised, then, when his uncle put a direct question to him. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet me see,\u2014it\u2019s going on for seven years now since you applied to me for a situation, eh, Tom?\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, sir; I\u2019m three-and-twenty now,\u201d said Tom. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh, it\u2019s as well not to say that, though; for you\u2019d pass for a good deal older, and age tells well in business. I remember your coming very well; I remember I saw there was some pluck in you, and that was what made me give you encouragement. And I\u2019m happy to say I was right; I\u2019m not often deceived. I was naturally a little shy at pushing my nephew, but I\u2019m happy to say you\u2019ve done me credit, sir; and if I\u2019d had a son o\u2019 my own, I shouldn\u2019t have been sorry to see him like you.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Deane tapped his box and opened it again, repeating in a tone of some feeling, \u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t have been sorry to see him like you.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m very glad I\u2019ve given you satisfaction, sir; I\u2019ve done my best,\u201d said Tom, in his proud, independent way. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, Tom, you\u2019ve given me satisfaction. I don\u2019t speak of your conduct as a son; though that weighs with me in my opinion of you. But what I have to do with, as a partner in our firm, is the qualities you\u2019ve shown as a man o\u2019 business. Ours is a fine business,\u2014a splendid concern, sir,\u2014and there\u2019s no reason why it shouldn\u2019t go on growing; there\u2019s a growing capital, and growing outlets for it; but there\u2019s another thing that\u2019s wanted for the prosperity of every concern, large or small, and that\u2019s men to conduct it,\u2014men of the right habits; none o\u2019 your flashy fellows, but such as are to be depended on. Now this is what Mr Guest and I see clear enough. Three years ago we took Gell into the concern; we gave him a share in the oil-mill. And why? Why, because Gell was a fellow whose services were worth a premium. So it will always be, sir. So it was with me. And though Gell is pretty near ten years older than you, there are other points in your favour.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Tom was getting a little nervous as Mr Deane went on speaking; he was conscious of something he had in his mind to say, which might not be agreeable to his uncle, simply because it was a new suggestion rather than an acceptance of the proposition he foresaw. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt stands to reason,\u201d Mr Deane went on, when he had finished his new pinch, \u201cthat your being my nephew weighs in your favour; but I don\u2019t deny that if you\u2019d been no relation of mine at all, your conduct in that affair of Pelley\u2019s bank would have led Mr Guest and myself to make some acknowledgment of the service you\u2019ve been to us; and, backed by your general conduct and business ability, it has made us determine on giving you a share in the business,\u2014a share which we shall be glad to increase as the years go on. We think that\u2019ll be better, on all grounds, than raising your salary. It\u2019ll give you more importance, and prepare you better for taking some of the anxiety off my shoulders by and by. I\u2019m equal to a good deal o\u2019 work at present, thank God; but I\u2019m getting older,\u2014there\u2019s no denying that. I told Mr Guest I would open the subject to you; and when you come back from this northern business, we can go into particulars. This is a great stride for a young fellow of three-and-twenty, but I\u2019m bound to say you\u2019ve deserved it.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to Mr Guest and you, sir; of course I feel the most indebted to ",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you"),", who first took me into the business, and have taken a good deal of pains with me since.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Tom spoke with a slight tremor, and paused after he had said this. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Mr Deane. \u201cI don\u2019t spare pains when I see they\u2019ll be of any use. I gave myself some trouble with Gell, else he wouldn\u2019t have been what he is.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I should like to mention to you uncle. I\u2019ve never spoken to you of it before. If you remember, at the time my father\u2019s property was sold, there was some thought of your firm buying the Mill; I know you thought it would be a very good investment, especially if steam were applied.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTo be sure, to be sure.

I\u2019ve a strong feeling about it. It was my father\u2019s dying wish that I should try and get it back again whenever I could; it was in his family for five generations. I promised my father; and besides that, I\u2019m attached to the place. I shall never like any other so well. And if it should ever suit your views to buy it for the firm, I should have a better chance of fulfilling my father\u2019s wish. I shouldn\u2019t have liked to mention the thing to you, only you\u2019ve been kind enough to say my services have been of some value. And I\u2019d give up a much greater chance in life for the sake of having the Mill again,\u2014I mean having it in my own hands, and gradually working off the price.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Deane had listened attentively, and now looked thoughtful.

Luke told me about it,\u2014our old miller. He says he sha\u2019n\u2019t stay unless there\u2019s an alteration.

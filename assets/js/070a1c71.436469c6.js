"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The afternoon sun was warm on the five workmen there, busy upon doors and window-frames and wainscoting. A scent of pine-wood from a tentlike pile of planks outside the open door mingled itself with the scent of the elder-bushes which were spreading their summer snow close to the open window opposite; the slanting sunbeams shone through the transparent shavings that flew before the steady plane, and lit up the fine grain of the oak panelling which stood propped against the wall. On a heap of those soft shavings a rough, grey shepherd dog had made himself a pleasant bed, and was lying with his nose between his fore-paws, occasionally wrinkling his brows to cast a glance at the tallest of the five workmen, who was carving a shield in the centre of a wooden mantelpiece. It was to this workman that the strong barytone belonged which was heard above the sound of plane and hammer singing\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Awake, my soul, and with the sun Thy daily stage of duty run; Shake off dull sloth... "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Here some measurement was to be taken which required more concentrated attention, and the sonorous voice subsided into a low whistle; but it presently broke out again with renewed vigour\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Let all thy converse be sincere, Thy conscience as the noonday clear. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Such a voice could only come from a broad chest, and the broad chest belonged to a large-boned, muscular man nearly six feet high, with a back so flat and a head so well poised that when he drew himself up to take a more distant survey of his work, he had the air of a soldier standing at ease. The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of strength; yet the long supple hand, with its broad finger-tips, looked ready for works of skill. In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon, and justified his name; but the jet-black hair, made the more noticeable by its contrast with the light paper cap, and the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked, prominent and mobile eyebrows, indicated a mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly hewn, and when in repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an expression of good-humoured honest intelligence. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It is clear at a glance that the next workman is Adam\u2019s brother. He is nearly as tall; he has the same type of features, the same hue of hair and complexion; but the strength of the family likeness seems only to render more conspicuous the remarkable difference of expression both in form and face. Seth\u2019s broad shoulders have a slight stoop; his eyes are grey; his eyebrows have less prominence and more repose than his brother\u2019s; and his glance, instead of being keen, is confiding and benign. He has thrown off his paper cap, and you see that his hair is not thick and straight, like Adam\u2019s, but thin and wavy, allowing you to discern the exact contour of a coronal arch that predominates very decidedly over the brow. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The idle tramps always felt sure they could get a copper from Seth; they scarcely ever spoke to Adam. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The concert of the tools and Adam\u2019s voice was at last broken by Seth, who, lifting the door at which he had been working intently, placed it against the wall, and said, \u201cThere!

And there\u2019s such a thing as being oversperitial; we must have something beside Gospel i\u2019 this world. Look at the canals, an\u2019 th\u2019 aqueduc\u2019s, an\u2019 th\u2019 coal-pit engines, and Arkwright\u2019s mills there at Cromford; a man must learn summat beside Gospel to make them things, I reckon.

I know a man must have the love o\u2019 God in his soul, and the Bible\u2019s God\u2019s word. But what does the Bible say? Why, it says as God put his sperrit into the workman as built the tabernacle, to make him do all the carved work and things as wanted a nice hand. And this is my way o\u2019 looking at it: there\u2019s the sperrit o\u2019 God in all things and all times\u2014weekday as well as Sunday\u2014and i\u2019 the great works and inventions, and i\u2019 the figuring and the mechanics. And God helps us with our headpieces and our hands as well as with our souls; and if a man does bits o\u2019 jobs out o\u2019 working hours\u2014builds a oven for \u2019s wife to save her from going to the bakehouse, or scrats at his bit o\u2019 garden and makes two potatoes grow istead o\u2019 one, he\u2019s doin\u2019 more good, and he\u2019s just as near to God, as if he was running after some preacher and a-praying and a-groaning.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell done, Adam!\u201d said Sandy Jim, who had paused from his planing to shift his planks while Adam was speaking; \u201cthat\u2019s the best sarmunt I\u2019ve heared this long while.

Ye may like work better nor play, but I like play better nor work; that\u2019ll \u2019commodate ye\u2014it laves ye th\u2019 more to do.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  With this exit speech, which he considered effective, Wiry Ben shouldered his basket and left the workshop, quickly followed by Mum Taft and Sandy Jim. Seth lingered, and looked wistfully at Adam, as if he expected him to say something. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cShalt go home before thee go\u2019st to the preaching?\u201d Adam asked, looking up. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay; I\u2019ve got my hat and things at Will Maskery\u2019s. I shan\u2019t be home before going for ten. I\u2019ll happen see Dinah Morris safe home, if she\u2019s willing. There\u2019s nobody comes with her from Poyser\u2019s, thee know\u2019st.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThen I\u2019ll tell mother not to look for thee,\u201d said Adam. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThee artna going to Poyser\u2019s thyself to-night?\u201d said Seth rather timidly, as he turned to leave the workshop. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, I\u2019m going to th\u2019 school.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hitherto Gyp had kept his comfortable bed, only lifting up his head and watching Adam more closely as he noticed the other workmen departing. But no sooner did Adam put his ruler in his pocket, and begin to twist his apron round his waist, than Gyp ran forward and looked up in his master\u2019s face with patient expectation. If Gyp had had a tail he would doubtless have wagged it, but being destitute of that vehicle for his emotions, he was like many other worthy personages, destined to appear more phlegmatic than nature had made him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat! Art ready for the basket, eh, Gyp?\u201d said Adam, with the same gentle modulation of voice as when he spoke to Seth. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Gyp jumped and gave a short bark, as much as to say, \u201cOf course.\u201d Poor fellow, he had not a great range of expression. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The basket was the one which on workdays held Adam\u2019s and Seth\u2019s dinner; and no official, walking in procession, could look more resolutely unconscious of all acquaintances than Gyp with his basket, trotting at his master\u2019s heels. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  On leaving the workshop Adam locked the door, took the key out, and carried it to the house on the other side of the woodyard. It was a low house, with smooth grey thatch and buff walls, looking pleasant and mellow in the evening light. The leaded windows were bright and speckless, and the door-stone was as clean as a white boulder at ebb tide. On the door-stone stood a clean old woman, in a dark-striped linen gown, a red kerchief, and a linen cap, talking to some speckled fowls which appeared to have been drawn towards her by an illusory expectation of cold potatoes or barley. The old woman\u2019s sight seemed to be dim, for she did not recognize Adam till he said, \u201cHere\u2019s the key, Dolly; lay it down for me in the house, will you?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAye, sure; but wunna ye come in, Adam? Miss Mary\u2019s i\u2019 th\u2019 house, and Mester Burge \u2019ull be back anon; he\u2019d be glad t\u2019 ha\u2019 ye to supper wi\u2019m, I\u2019ll be\u2019s warrand.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, Dolly, thank you; I\u2019m off home. Good evening.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam hastened with long strides, Gyp close to his heels, out of the workyard, and along the highroad leading away from the village and down to the valley. As he reached the foot of the slope, an elderly horseman, with his portmanteau strapped behind him, stopped his horse when Adam had passed him, and turned round to have another long look at the stalwart workman in paper cap, leather breeches, and dark-blue worsted stockings. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam, unconscious of the admiration he was exciting, presently struck across the fields, and now broke out into the tune which had all day long been running in his head: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Let all thy converse be sincere, Thy conscience as the noonday clear; For God\u2019s all-seeing eye surveys Thy secret thoughts, thy works and ways."))}y.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

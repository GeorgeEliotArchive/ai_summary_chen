She thought of no other change that might have happened. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  She hurried along the gravel-walk and entered the house before Tom; but in the entrance she was startled by a strong smell of tobacco. The parlour door was ajar; that was where the smell came from. It was very strange; could any visitor be smoking at a time like this? Was her mother there? If so, she must be told that Tom was come. Maggie, after this pause of surprise, was only in the act of opening the door when Tom came up, and they both looked into the parlour together. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There was a coarse, dingy man, of whose face Tom had some vague recollection, sitting in his father\u2019s chair, smoking, with a jug and glass beside him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The truth flashed on Tom\u2019s mind in an instant. To \u201chave the bailiff in the house,\u201d and \u201cto be sold up,\u201d were phrases which he had been used to, even as a little boy; they were part of the disgrace and misery of \u201cfailing,\u201d of losing all one\u2019s money, and being ruined,\u2014sinking into the condition of poor working people. It seemed only natural this should happen, since his father had lost all his property, and he thought of no more special cause for this particular form of misfortune than the loss of the lawsuit. But the immediate presence of this disgrace was so much keener an experience to Tom than the worst form of apprehension, that he felt at this moment as if his real trouble had only just begun: it was a touch on the irritated nerve compared with its spontaneous dull aching. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHow do you do, sir?\u201d said the man, taking the pipe out of his mouth, with rough, embarrassed civility. The two young startled faces made him a little uncomfortable. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But Tom turned away hastily without speaking; the sight was too hateful. Maggie had not understood the appearance of this stranger, as Tom had. She followed him, whispering: \u201cWho can it be, Tom? What is the matter?\u201d Then, with a sudden undefined dread lest this stranger might have something to do with a change in her father, she rushed upstairs, checking herself at the bedroom door to throw off her bonnet, and enter on tiptoe. All was silent there; her father was lying, heedless of everything around him, with his eyes closed as when she had left him. A servant was there, but not her mother. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhere\u2019s my mother?\u201d she whispered. The servant did not know. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie hastened out, and said to Tom; \u201cFather is lying quiet; let us go and look for my mother. I wonder where she is.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver was not downstairs, not in any of the bedrooms. There was but one room below the attic which Maggie had left unsearched; it was the storeroom, where her mother kept all her linen and all the precious \u201cbest things\u201d that were only unwrapped and brought out on special occasions. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom, preceding Maggie, as they returned along the passage, opened the door of this room, and immediately said, \u201cMother!\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver was seated there with all her laid-up treasures. One of the linen chests was open; the silver teapot was unwrapped from its many folds of paper, and the best china was laid out on the top of the closed linen-chest; spoons and skewers and ladles were spread in rows on the shelves; and the poor woman was shaking her head and weeping, with a bitter tension of the mouth, over the mark, \u201cElizabeth Dodson,\u201d on the corner of some tablecloths she held in her lap. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  She dropped them, and started up as Tom spoke. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, my boy, my boy!\u201d she said, clasping him round the neck. \u201cTo think as I should live to see this day!

And the pattern as I chose myself, and bleached so beautiful, and I marked \u2019em so as nobody ever saw such marking,\u2014they must cut the cloth to get it out, for it\u2019s a particular stitch. And they\u2019re all to be sold, and go into strange people\u2019s houses, and perhaps be cut with the knives, and wore out before I\u2019m dead. You\u2019ll never have one of \u2019em, my boy,\u201d she said, looking up at Tom with her eyes full of tears, \u201cand I meant \u2019em for you. I wanted you to have all o\u2019 this pattern. Maggie could have had the large check\u2014it never shows so well when the dishes are on it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom was touched to the quick, but there was an angry reaction immediately. His face flushed as he said: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut will my aunts let them be sold, mother? Do they know about it? They\u2019ll never let your linen go, will they?

And to think as he should ha\u2019 married me, and brought me to this.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs Tulliver burst out crying afresh, and she sobbed with her handkerchief at her eyes a few moments, but then removing it, she said in a deprecating way, still half sobbing, as if she were called upon to speak before she could command her voice,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd I ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"did")," say to him times and times, \u2018Whativer you do, don\u2019t go to law,\u2019 and what more could I do?

The poor lad went to her and kissed her, and she clung to him. For the first time Tom thought of his father with some reproach. His natural inclination to blame, hitherto kept entirely in abeyance toward his father by the predisposition to think him always right, simply on the ground that he was Tom Tulliver\u2019s father, was turned into this new channel by his mother\u2019s plaints; and with his indignation against Wakem there began to mingle some indignation of another sort. Perhaps his father might have helped bringing them all down in the world, and making people talk of them with contempt, but no one should talk long of Tom Tulliver with contempt. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The natural strength and firmness of his nature was beginning to assert itself, urged by the double stimulus of resentment against his aunts, and the sense that he must behave like a man and take care of his mother.

The implied reproaches against her father\u2014her father, who was lying there in a sort of living death\u2014neutralised all her pity for griefs about tablecloths and china; and her anger on her father\u2019s account was heightened by some egoistic resentment at Tom\u2019s silent concurrence with her mother in shutting her out from the common calamity. She had become almost indifferent to her mother\u2019s habitual depreciation of her, but she was keenly alive to any sanction of it, however passive, that she might suspect in Tom. Poor Maggie was by no means made up of unalloyed devotedness, but put forth large claims for herself where she loved strongly. She burst out at last in an agitated, almost violent tone: \u201cMother, how can you talk so; as if you cared only for things with ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"your")," name on, and not for what has my father\u2019s name too; and to care about anything but dear father himself!\u2014when he\u2019s lying there, and may never speak to us again. Tom, you ought to say so too; you ought not to let any one find fault with my father.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie, almost choked with mingled grief and anger, left the room, and took her old place on her father\u2019s bed. Her heart went out to him with a stronger movement than ever, at the thought that people would blame him. Maggie hated blame; she had been blamed all her life, and nothing had come of it but evil tempers. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Her father had always defended and excused her, and her loving remembrance of his tenderness was a force within her that would enable her to do or bear anything for his sake.

She ought to have learned better than have those hectoring, assuming manners, by this time. But he presently went into his father\u2019s room, and the sight there touched him in a way that effaced the slighter impressions of the previous hour. When Maggie saw how he was moved, she went to him and put her arm round his neck as he sat by the bed, and the two children forgot everything else in the sense that they had one father and one sorrow."))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

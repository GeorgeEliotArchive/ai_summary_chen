Gwendolen, who had always disliked needlework, had taken to it with apparent zeal since her engagement, and now held a piece of white embroidery which, on examination, would have shown many false stitches. During the last eight or nine days their hours had been chiefly spent on horseback, but some margin had always been left for this more difficult sort of companionship, which, however, Gwendolen had not found disagreeable. She was very well satisfied with Grandcourt. His answers to her lively questions about what he had seen and done in his life, bore drawling very well. From the first she had noticed that he knew what to say; and she was constantly feeling not only that he had nothing of the fool in his composition, but that by some subtle means he communicated to her the impression that all the folly lay with other people, who did what he did not care to do. A man who seems to have been able to command the best, has a sovereign power of depreciation. Then Grandcourt\u2019s behavior as a lover had hardly at all passed the limit of an amorous homage which was inobtrusive as a wafted odor of roses, and spent all its effects in a gratified vanity. One day, indeed, he had kissed not her cheek but her neck a little below her ear; and Gwendolen, taken by surprise, had started up with a marked agitation which made him rise too and say, \u201cI beg your pardon\u2014did I annoy you?\u201d \u201cOh, it was nothing,\u201d said Gwendolen, rather afraid of herself, \u201conly I cannot bear\u2014to be kissed under my ear.\u201d She sat down again with a little playful laugh, but all the while she felt her heart beating with a vague fear: she was no longer at liberty to flout him as she had flouted poor Rex.

But people are not obliged to know anything about his birth; you see, he is very well received.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cI wonder whether he knows about it; and whether he is angry with his father?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cMy dear child, why should you think of that?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cWhy?\u201d said Gwendolen, impetuously, sitting up in her bed. \u201cHaven\u2019t children reason to be angry with their parents? How can they help their parents marrying or not marrying?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"But a consciousness rushed upon her, which made her fall back again on her pillow. It was not only what she would have felt months before\u2014that she might seem to be reproaching her mother for that second marriage of hers; what she chiefly felt now was that she had been led on to a condemnation which seemed to make her own marriage a forbidden thing. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"There was no further talk, and till sleep came over her Gwendolen lay struggling with the reasons against that marriage\u2014reasons which pressed upon her newly now that they were unexpectedly mirrored in the story of a man whose slight relations with her had, by some hidden affinity, bitten themselves into the most permanent layers of feeling. It was characteristic that, with all her debating, she was never troubled by the question whether the indefensibleness of her marriage did not include the fact that she had accepted Grandcourt solely as a man whom it was convenient for her to marry, not in the least as one to whom she would be binding herself in duty. Gwendolen\u2019s ideas were pitiably crude; but many grand difficulties of life are apt to force themselves on us in our crudity. And to judge wisely, I suppose we must know how things appear to the unwise; that kind of appearance making the larger part of the world\u2019s history. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"In the morning there was a double excitement for her. She was going to hunt, from which scruples about propriety had threatened to hinder her, until it was found that Mrs. Torrington was horsewoman enough to accompany her\u2014going to hunt for the first time since her escapade with Rex; and she was going again to see Deronda, in whom, since last night, her interest had so gathered that she expected, as people do about revealed celebrities, to see something in his appearance which she had missed before. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"What was he going to be? What sort of life had he before him\u2014he being nothing of any consequence? And with only a little difference in events he might have been as important as Grandcourt, nay\u2014her imagination inevitably went into that direction\u2014might have held the very estates which Grandcourt was to have. But now, Deronda would probably some day see her mistress of the Abbey at Topping, see her bearing the title which would have been his own wife\u2019s. These obvious, futile thoughts of what might have been, made a new epoch for Gwendolen. She, whose unquestionable habit it had been to take the best that came to her for less than her own claim, had now to see the position which tempted her in a new light, as a hard, unfair exclusion of others. What she had now heard about Deronda seemed to her imagination to throw him into one group with Mrs. Glasher and her children; before whom she felt herself in an attitude of apology\u2014she who had hitherto been surrounded by a group that in her opinion had need be apologetic to her. Perhaps Deronda himself was thinking of these things. Could he know of Mrs. Glasher? If he knew that she knew, he would despise her; but he could have no such knowledge. Would he, without that, despise her for marrying Grandcourt? His possible judgment of her actions was telling on her as importunately as Klesmer\u2019s judgment of her powers; but she found larger room for resistance to a disapproval of her marriage, because it is easier to make our conduct seem justifiable to ourselves than to make our ability strike others. \u201cHow can I help it?\u201d is not our favorite apology for incompetency. But Gwendolen felt some strength in saying, "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cHow can I help what other people have done? Things would not come right if I were to turn round now and declare that I would not marry Mr. Grandcourt.\u201d And such turning round was out of the question. The horses in the chariot she had mounted were going at full speed. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"This mood of youthful, elated desperation had a tidal recurrence. She could dare anything that lay before her sooner than she could choose to go backward, into humiliation; and it was even soothing to think that there would now be as much ill-doing in the one as in the other. But the immediate delightful fact was the hunt, where she would see Deronda, and where he would see her; for always lurking ready to obtrude before other thoughts about him was the impression that he was very much interested in her. But to-day she was resolved not to repeat her folly of yesterday, as if she were anxious to say anything to him. Indeed, the hunt would be too absorbing. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"And so it was for a long while. Deronda was there, and within her sight very often; but this only added to the stimulus of a pleasure which Gwendolen had only once before tasted, and which seemed likely always to give a delight independent of any crosses, except such as took away the chance of riding. No accident happened to throw them together; the run took them within convenient reach of home, and the agreeable sombreness of the gray November afternoon, with a long stratum of yellow light in the west, Gwendolen was returning with the company from Diplow, who were attending her on the way to Offendene. Now the sense of glorious excitement was over and gone, she was getting irritably disappointed that she had had no opportunity of speaking to Deronda, whom she would not see again, since he was to go away in a couple of days. What was she going to say? That was not quite certain. She wanted to speak to him. Grandcourt was by her side; Mrs. Torrington, her husband, and another gentleman in advance; and Deronda\u2019s horse she could hear behind. The wish to speak to him and have him speaking to her was becoming imperious; and there was no chance of it unless she simply asserted her will and defied everything. Where the order of things could give way to Miss Gwendolen, it must be made to do so. They had lately emerged from a wood of pines and beeches, where the twilight stillness had a repressing effect, which increased her impatience. The horse-hoofs again heard behind at some little distance were a growing irritation. She reined in her horse and looked behind her; Grandcourt after a few paces, also paused; but she, waving her whip and nodding sideways with playful imperiousness, said, \u201cGo on! I want to speak to Mr. Deronda.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Grandcourt hesitated; but that he would have done after any proposition. It was an awkward situation for him. No gentleman, before marriage, could give the emphasis of refusal to a command delivered in this playful way. He rode on slowly, and she waited till Deronda came up. He looked at her with tacit inquiry, and she said at once, letting her horse go alongside of his, "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cMr. Deronda, you must enlighten my ignorance. I want to know why you thought it wrong for me to gamble. Is it because I am a woman?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cNot altogether; but I regretted it the more because you were a woman,\u201d said Deronda, with an irrepressible smile. Apparently it must be understood between them now that it was he who sent the necklace. \u201cI think it would be better for men not to gamble. It is a besotting kind of taste, likely to turn into a disease. And, besides, there is something revolting to me in raking a heap of money together, and internally chuckling over it, when others are feeling the loss of it. I should even call it base, if it were more than an exceptional lapse. There are enough inevitable turns of fortune which force us to see that our gain is another\u2019s loss:\u2014that is one of the ugly aspects of life. One would like to reduce it as much as one could, not get amusement out of exaggerating it.\u201d Deronda\u2019s voice had gathered some indignation while he was speaking. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cBut you do admit that we can\u2019t help things,\u201d said Gwendolen, with a drop in her tone. The answer had not been anything like what she had expected. \u201cI mean that things are so in spite of us; we can\u2019t always help it that our gain is another\u2019s loss.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cClearly. Because of that, we should help it where we can.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Gwendolen, biting her lip inside, paused a moment, and then forcing herself to speak with an air of playfulness again, said, "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cBut why should you regret it more because I am a woman?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cPerhaps because we need that you should be better than we are.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cBut suppose ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"we")," need that men should be better than we are,\u201d said Gwendolen with a little air of \u201ccheck!\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cThat is rather a difficulty,\u201d said Deronda, smiling. \u201cI suppose I should have said, we each of us think it would be better for the other to be good.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cYou see, I needed you to be better than I was\u2014and you thought so,\u201d said Gwendolen, nodding and laughing, while she put her horse forward and joined Grandcourt, who made no observation. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what I had to say to Mr. Deronda?\u201d said Gwendolen, whose own pride required her to account for her conduct.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cNow that is the first impolite word you have spoken\u2014that you don\u2019t wish to hear what I had to say,\u201d said Gwendolen, playing at a pout.

But he was not fond of being told to ride on. She saw he was piqued, but did not mind. She had accomplished her object of speaking again to Deronda before he raised his hat and turned with the rest toward Diplow, while her lover attended her to Offendene, where he was to bid farewell before a whole day\u2019s absence on the unspecified journey. Grandcourt had spoken truth in calling the journey a bore: he was going by train to Gadsmere."))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

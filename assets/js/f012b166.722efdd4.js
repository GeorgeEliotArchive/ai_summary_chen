But it is early afternoon and not evening, and the edge of sharpness in the spring air makes her draw her large shawl close about her and trip along rather quickly; though she looks round, as usual, that she may take in the sight of her beloved trees. There is a more eager, inquiring look in her eyes than there was last June, and a smile is hovering about her lips, as if some playful speech were awaiting the right hearer. The hearer was not long in appearing. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTake back your ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Corinne"),",\u201d said Maggie, drawing a book from under her shawl. \u201cYou were right in telling me she would do me no good; but you were wrong in thinking I should wish to be like her.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWouldn\u2019t you really like to be a tenth Muse, then, Maggie?\u201d said Philip looking up in her face as we look at a first parting in the clouds that promises us a bright heaven once more.

I foresaw that that light-complexioned girl would win away all the love from Corinne and make her miserable. I\u2019m determined to read no more books where the blond-haired women carry away all the happiness. I should begin to have a prejudice against them. If you could give me some story, now, where the dark woman triumphs, it would restore the balance. I want to avenge Rebecca and Flora MacIvor and Minna, and all the rest of the dark unhappy ones. Since you are my tutor, you ought to preserve my mind from prejudices; you are always arguing against prejudices.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, perhaps you will avenge the dark women in your own person, and carry away all the love from your cousin Lucy.

Besides, I never go to aunt Deane\u2019s when any one is there; it is only because dear Lucy is good, and loves me, that she comes to see me, and will have me go to see her sometimes.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMaggie,\u201d said Philip, with surprise, \u201cit is not like you to take playfulness literally.

I thought you wanted to remind me that I am vain, and wish every one to admire me most. But it isn\u2019t for that that I\u2019m jealous for the dark women,\u2014not because I\u2019m dark myself; it\u2019s because I always care the most about the unhappy people.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But she was not looking indifferent now. Struck with the unusual emotion in Philip\u2019s tone, she had turned quickly to look at him; and as he went on speaking, a great change came over her face,\u2014a flush and slight spasm of the features, such as we see in people who hear some news that will require them to readjust their conceptions of the past. She was quite silent, and walking on toward the trunk of a fallen tree, she sat down, as if she had no strength to spare for her muscles. She was trembling.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI think I could hardly love any one better; there is nothing but what I love you for.\u201d She paused a little while, and then added: \u201cBut it will be better for us not to say any more about it, won\u2019t it, dear Philip? You know we couldn\u2019t even be friends, if our friendship were discovered.

But it has made me restless; it has made me think a great deal about the world; and I have impatient thoughts again,\u2014I get weary of my home; and then it cuts me to the heart afterward, that I should ever have felt weary of my father and mother. I think what you call being benumbed was better\u2014better for me\u2014for then my selfish desires were benumbed.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Philip had risen again, and was walking backward and forward impatiently. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, Maggie, you have wrong ideas of self-conquest, as I\u2019ve often told you. What you call self-conquest\u2014blinding and deafening yourself to all but one train of impressions\u2014is only the culture of monomania in a nature like yours.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He had spoken with some irritation, but now he sat down by her again and took her hand. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t think of the past now, Maggie; think only of our love. If you can really cling to me with all your heart, every obstacle will be overcome in time; we need only wait. I can live on hope. Look at me, Maggie; tell me again it is possible for you to love me. Don\u2019t look away from me to that cloven tree; it is a bad omen.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  She turned her large dark glance upon him with a sad smile. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCome, Maggie, say one kind word, or else you were better to me at Lorton.

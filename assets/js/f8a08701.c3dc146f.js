Mr Tulliver, who had begun, in his intervals of consciousness, to manifest an irritability which often appeared to have as a direct effect the recurrence of spasmodic rigidity and insensibility, had lain in this living death throughout the critical hours when the noise of the sale came nearest to his chamber. Mr Turnbull had decided that it would be a less risk to let him remain where he was than to remove him to Luke\u2019s cottage,\u2014a plan which the good Luke had proposed to Mrs Tulliver, thinking it would be very bad if the master were \u201cto waken up\u201d at the noise of the sale; and the wife and children had sat imprisoned in the silent chamber, watching the large prostrate figure on the bed, and trembling lest the blank face should suddenly show some response to the sounds which fell on their own ears with such obstinate, painful repetition. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But it was over at last, that time of importunate certainty and eye-straining suspense. The sharp sound of a voice, almost as metallic as the rap that followed it, had ceased; the tramping of footsteps on the gravel had died out. Mrs Tulliver\u2019s blond face seemed aged ten years by the last thirty hours; the poor woman\u2019s mind had been busy divining when her favourite things were being knocked down by the terrible hammer; her heart had been fluttering at the thought that first one thing and then another had gone to be identified as hers in the hateful publicity of the Golden Lion; and all the while she had to sit and make no sign of this inward agitation. Such things bring lines in well-rounded faces, and broaden the streaks of white among the hairs that once looked as if they had been dipped in pure sunshine. Already, at three o\u2019clock, Kezia, the good-hearted, bad-tempered housemaid, who regarded all people that came to the sale as her personal enemies, the dirt on whose feet was of a peculiarly vile quality, had begun to scrub and swill with an energy much assisted by a continual low muttering against \u201cfolks as came to buy up other folk\u2019s things,\u201d and made light of \u201cscrazing\u201d the tops of mahogany tables over which better folks than themselves had had to\u2014suffer a waste of tissue through evaporation. She was not scrubbing indiscriminately, for there would be further dirt of the same atrocious kind made by people who had still to fetch away their purchases; but she was bent on bringing the parlour, where that \u201cpipe-smoking pig,\u201d the bailiff, had sat, to such an appearance of scant comfort as could be given to it by cleanliness and the few articles of furniture bought in for the family. Her mistress and the young folks should have their tea in it that night, Kezia was determined. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It was between five and six o\u2019clock, near the usual teatime, when she came upstairs and said that Master Tom was wanted. The person who wanted him was in the kitchen, and in the first moments, by the imperfect fire and candle light, Tom had not even an indefinite sense of any acquaintance with the rather broad-set but active figure, perhaps two years older than himself, that looked at him with a pair of blue eyes set in a disc of freckles, and pulled some curly red locks with a strong intention of respect. A low-crowned oilskin-covered hat, and a certain shiny deposit of dirt on the rest of the costume, as of tablets prepared for writing upon, suggested a calling that had to do with boats; but this did not help Tom\u2019s memory. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSarvant, Master Tom,\u201d said he of the red locks, with a smile which seemed to break through a self-imposed air of melancholy. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me again, I doubt,\u201d he went on, as Tom continued to look at him inquiringly; \u201cbut I\u2019d like to talk to you by yourself a bit, please.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere\u2019s a fire i\u2019 the parlour, Master Tom,\u201d said Kezia, who objected to leaving the kitchen in the crisis of toasting.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The bright fire in the parlour was the only light that showed the few chairs, the bureau, the carpetless floor, and the one table\u2014no, not the ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"one")," table; there was a second table, in a corner, with a large Bible and a few other books upon it. It was this new strange bareness that Tom felt first, before he thought of looking again at the face which was also lit up by the fire, and which stole a half-shy, questioning glance at him as the entirely strange voice said: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy! you don\u2019t remember Bob, then, as you gen the pocket-knife to, Mr Tom?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The rough-handled pocket-knife was taken out in the same moment, and the largest blade opened by way of irresistible demonstration.

But the next moment the sense of the altered room came upon Maggie with a force that overpowered the thought of Bob\u2019s presence. Her eyes had immediately glanced from him to the place where the bookcase had hung; there was nothing now but the oblong unfaded space on the wall, and below it the small table with the Bible and the few other books.

But a happy time, nevertheless, for it was taking him nearer and nearer to March, when they were to be married, and all the little preparations for their new housekeeping marked the progress towards the longed-for day. Two new rooms had been \u201crun up\u201d to the old house, for his mother and Seth were to live with them after all. Lisbeth had cried so piteously at the thought of leaving Adam that he had gone to Hetty and asked her if, for the love of him, she would put up with his mother\u2019s ways and consent to live with her. To his great delight, Hetty said, \u201cYes; I\u2019d as soon she lived with us as not.\u201d Hetty\u2019s mind was oppressed at that moment with a worse difficulty than poor Lisbeth\u2019s ways; she could not care about them. So Adam was consoled for the disappointment he had felt when Seth had come back from his visit to Snowfield and said \u201cit was no use\u2014Dinah\u2019s heart wasna turned towards marrying.\u201d For when he told his mother that Hetty was willing they should all live together and there was no more need of them to think of parting, she said, in a more contented tone than he had heard her speak in since it had been settled that he was to be married, \u201cEh, my lad, I\u2019ll be as still as th\u2019 ould tabby, an\u2019 ne\u2019er want to do aught but th\u2019 offal work, as ",(0,h.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"she")," wonna like t\u2019 do. An\u2019 then we needna part the platters an\u2019 things, as ha\u2019 stood on the shelf together sin\u2019 afore thee wast born.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  There was only one cloud that now and then came across Adam\u2019s sunshine: Hetty seemed unhappy sometimes. But to all his anxious, tender questions, she replied with an assurance that she was quite contented and wished nothing different; and the next time he saw her she was more lively than usual. It might be that she was a little overdone with work and anxiety now, for soon after Christmas Mrs. Poyser had taken another cold, which had brought on inflammation, and this illness had confined her to her room all through January. Hetty had to manage everything downstairs, and half-supply Molly\u2019s place too, while that good damsel waited on her mistress, and she seemed to throw herself so entirely into her new functions, working with a grave steadiness which was new in her, that Mr. Poyser often told Adam she was wanting to show him what a good housekeeper he would have; but he \u201cdoubted the lass was o\u2019erdoing it\u2014she must have a bit o\u2019 rest when her aunt could come downstairs.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  This desirable event of Mrs. Poyser\u2019s coming downstairs happened in the early part of February, when some mild weather thawed the last patch of snow on the Binton Hills. On one of these days, soon after her aunt came down, Hetty went to Treddleston to buy some of the wedding things which were wanting, and which Mrs. Poyser had scolded her for neglecting, observing that she supposed \u201cit was because they were not for th\u2019 outside, else she\u2019d ha\u2019 bought \u2019em fast enough.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  It was about ten o\u2019clock when Hetty set off, and the slight hoar-frost that had whitened the hedges in the early morning had disappeared as the sun mounted the cloudless sky. Bright February days have a stronger charm of hope about them than any other days in the year. One likes to pause in the mild rays of the sun, and look over the gates at the patient plough-horses turning at the end of the furrow, and think that the beautiful year is all before one. The birds seem to feel just the same: their notes are as clear as the clear air. There are no leaves on the trees and hedgerows, but how green all the grassy fields are! And the dark purplish brown of the ploughed earth and of the bare branches is beautiful too. What a glad world this looks like, as one drives or rides along the valleys and over the hills! I have often thought so when, in foreign countries, where the fields and woods have looked to me like our English Loamshire\u2014the rich land tilled with just as much care, the woods rolling down the gentle slopes to the green meadows\u2014I have come on something by the roadside which has reminded me that I am not in Loamshire: an image of a great agony\u2014the agony of the Cross. It has stood perhaps by the clustering apple-blossoms, or in the broad sunshine by the cornfield, or at a turning by the wood where a clear brook was gurgling below; and surely, if there came a traveller to this world who knew nothing of the story of man\u2019s life upon it, this image of agony would seem to him strangely out of place in the midst of this joyous nature. He would not know that hidden behind the apple-blossoms, or among the golden corn, or under the shrouding boughs of the wood, there might be a human heart beating heavily with anguish\u2014perhaps a young blooming girl, not knowing where to turn for refuge from swift-advancing shame, understanding no more of this life of ours than a foolish lost lamb wandering farther and farther in the nightfall on the lonely heath, yet tasting the bitterest of life\u2019s bitterness. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Such things are sometimes hidden among the sunny fields and behind the blossoming orchards; and the sound of the gurgling brook, if you came close to one spot behind a small bush, would be mingled for your ear with a despairing human sob. No wonder man\u2019s religion has much sorrow in it: no wonder he needs a suffering God. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty, in her red cloak and warm bonnet, with her basket in her hand, is turning towards a gate by the side of the Treddleston road, but not that she may have a more lingering enjoyment of the sunshine and think with hope of the long unfolding year. She hardly knows that the sun is shining; and for weeks, now, when she has hoped at all, it has been for something at which she herself trembles and shudders. She only wants to be out of the high-road, that she may walk slowly and not care how her face looks, as she dwells on wretched thoughts; and through this gate she can get into a field-path behind the wide thick hedgerows. Her great dark eyes wander blankly over the fields like the eyes of one who is desolate, homeless, unloved, not the promised bride of a brave tender man. But there are no tears in them: her tears were all wept away in the weary night, before she went to sleep. At the next stile the pathway branches off: there are two roads before her\u2014one along by the hedgerow, which will by and by lead her into the road again, the other across the fields, which will take her much farther out of the way into the Scantlands, low shrouded pastures where she will see nobody. She chooses this and begins to walk a little faster, as if she had suddenly thought of an object towards which it was worth while to hasten. Soon she is in the Scantlands, where the grassy land slopes gradually downwards, and she leaves the level ground to follow the slope. Farther on there is a clump of trees on the low ground, and she is making her way towards it. No, it is not a clump of trees, but a dark shrouded pool, so full with the wintry rains that the under boughs of the elder-bushes lie low beneath the water. She sits down on the grassy bank, against the stooping stem of the great oak that hangs over the dark pool. She has thought of this pool often in the nights of the month that has just gone by, and now at last she is come to see it. She clasps her hands round her knees, and leans forward, and looks earnestly at it, as if trying to guess what sort of bed it would make for her young round limbs. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  No, she has not courage to jump into that cold watery bed, and if she had, they might find her\u2014they might find out why she had drowned herself. There is but one thing left to her: she must go away, go where they can\u2019t find her. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  After the first on-coming of her great dread, some weeks after her betrothal to Adam, she had waited and waited, in the blind vague hope that something would happen to set her free from her terror; but she could wait no longer. All the force of her nature had been concentrated on the one effort of concealment, and she had shrunk with irresistible dread from every course that could tend towards a betrayal of her miserable secret. Whenever the thought of writing to Arthur had occurred to her, she had rejected it. He could do nothing for her that would shelter her from discovery and scorn among the relatives and neighbours who once more made all her world, now her airy dream had vanished. Her imagination no longer saw happiness with Arthur, for he could do nothing that would satisfy or soothe her pride. No, something else would happen\u2014something ",(0,h.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"must")," happen\u2014to set her free from this dread. In young, childish, ignorant souls there is constantly this blind trust in some unshapen chance: it is as hard to a boy or girl to believe that a great wretchedness will actually befall them as to believe that they will die. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  But now necessity was pressing hard upon her\u2014now the time of her marriage was close at hand\u2014she could no longer rest in this blind trust. She must run away; she must hide herself where no familiar eyes could detect her; and then the terror of wandering out into the world, of which she knew nothing, made the possibility of going to Arthur a thought which brought some comfort with it. She felt so helpless now, so unable to fashion the future for herself, that the prospect of throwing herself on him had a relief in it which was stronger than her pride. As she sat by the pool and shuddered at the dark cold water, the hope that he would receive her tenderly\u2014that he would care for her and think for her\u2014was like a sense of lulling warmth, that made her for the moment indifferent to everything else; and she began now to think of nothing but the scheme by which she should get away. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  She had had a letter from Dinah lately, full of kind words about the coming marriage, which she had heard of from Seth; and when Hetty had read this letter aloud to her uncle, he had said, \u201cI wish Dinah \u2019ud come again now, for she\u2019d be a comfort to your aunt when you\u2019re gone. What do you think, my wench, o\u2019 going to see her as soon as you can be spared and persuading her to come back wi\u2019 you? You might happen persuade her wi\u2019 telling her as her aunt wants her, for all she writes o\u2019 not being able to come.\u201d Hetty had not liked the thought of going to Snowfield, and felt no longing to see Dinah, so she only said, \u201cIt\u2019s so far off, Uncle.\u201d But now she thought this proposed visit would serve as a pretext for going away. She would tell her aunt when she got home again that she should like the change of going to Snowfield for a week or ten days. And then, when she got to Stoniton, where nobody knew her, she would ask for the coach that would take her on the way to Windsor. Arthur was at Windsor, and she would go to him. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  As soon as Hetty had determined on this scheme, she rose from the grassy bank of the pool, took up her basket, and went on her way to Treddleston, for she must buy the wedding things she had come out for, though she would never want them. She must be careful not to raise any suspicion that she was going to run away. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs. Poyser was quite agreeably surprised that Hetty wished to go and see Dinah and try to bring her back to stay over the wedding. The sooner she went the better, since the weather was pleasant now; and Adam, when he came in the evening, said, if Hetty could set off to-morrow, he would make time to go with her to Treddleston and see her safe into the Stoniton coach. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI wish I could go with you and take care of you, Hetty,\u201d he said, the next morning, leaning in at the coach door; \u201cbut you won\u2019t stay much beyond a week\u2014the time \u2019ull seem long.\u201d "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  He was looking at her fondly, and his strong hand held hers in its grasp. Hetty felt a sense of protection in his presence\u2014she was used to it now: if she could have had the past undone and known no other love than her quiet liking for Adam! The tears rose as she gave him the last look. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGod bless her for loving me,\u201d said Adam, as he went on his way to work again, with Gyp at his heels. "),(0,h.yg)("p",null,"  But Hetty\u2019s tears were not for Adam\u2014not for the anguish that would come upon him when he found she was gone from him for ever.

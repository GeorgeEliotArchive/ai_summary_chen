What Jermyn was really most anxious about, was to learn from Mrs. Transome whether anything had transpired that was significant of Harold's disposition toward him, which he suspected to be very far from friendly. Jermyn was not naturally flinty-hearted: at five-and-twenty he had written verses, and had got himself wet through in order not to disappoint a dark-eyed woman whom he was proud to believe in love with him; but a family man with grown up sons and daughters, a man with a professional position and complicated affairs that make it hard to ascertain the exact relation between property and liabilities, necessarily thinks of himself and what may be impending.

To-day she was more conscious than usual of that bitterness which was always in her mind in Jermyn\'s presence, but which was carefully suppressed:--suppressed because she could not endure that the degradation she inwardly felt should ever become visible or audible in acts or words of her own--should ever be reflected in any word or look of his.

It was a resolve which had become a habit, that she would never quarrel with this man--never tell him what she saw him to be. She had kept her woman's pride and sensibility intact: through all her life there had vibrated the maiden need to have her hand kissed and be the object of chivalry. And so she sank into silence again, trembling. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Jermyn felt annoyed--nothing more. There was nothing in his mind corresponding to the intricate meshes of sensitiveness in Mrs. Transome's.

Moral vulgarity cleaved to him like an hereditary odor. He blundered now. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,'"My dear Mrs. Transome," he said, in a tone of bland kindness, "you are agitated--you appear angry with me.

I have always met your wishes both in happy circumstances and in unhappy ones. I should be ready to do so now, if it were possible." '),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Every sentence was as pleasant to her as if it had been cut in her bared arm. Some men's kindness and love-making are more exasperating, more humiliating than others' derision; but the pitiable woman who has once made herself secretly dependent on a man who is beneath her in feeling, must bear that humiliation for fear of worse. Coarse kindness is at least better than coarse anger; and in all private quarrels the duller nature is triumphant by reason of its dullness. Mrs. Transome knew in her inmost soul that those relations which had sealed her lips on Jermyn's conduct in business matters, had been with him a ground for presuming that he should have impunity in any lax dealing into which circumstances had led him. She knew that she herself had endured all the more privation because of his dishonest selfishness. And now, Harold's long-deferred heirship, and his return with startlingly unexpected penetration, activity, and assertion of mastery, had placed them both in the full presence of a difficulty which had been prepared by the years of vague uncertainty as to issues. In this position, with a great dread hanging over her, which Jermyn knew, and ought to have felt that he had caused her, she was inclined to lash him with indignation, to scorch him with the words that were just the fit names for his doings--inclined all the more when he spoke with an insolent blandness, ignoring all that was truly in her heart. But no sooner did the words \"You have brought it on me\" rise within her than she heard within also the retort, \"You brought it on yourself.\" Not for all the world beside could she bear to hear that retort uttered from without.

A man of sixty, with a wife whose Duffield connections were of the highest respectability, with a family of tall daughters, an expensive establishment, and a large professional business, owed a great deal more to himself as the mainstay of all those solidities, than to feelings and ideas which were quite unsubstantial. There were many unfortunate coincidences which placed Mr. Jermyn in an uncomfortable position just now; he had not been much to blame, he considered; if it had not been for a sudden turn of affairs no one would have complained. He defied any man to say that he had intended to wrong people; he was able to refund, to make reprisals, if they could be fairly demanded. Only he would certainly have preferred that they should not be demanded.

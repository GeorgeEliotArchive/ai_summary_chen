Bright, admiring glances from a handsome young gentleman with white hands, a gold chain, occasional regimentals, and wealth and grandeur immeasurable\u2014those were the warm rays that set poor Hetty\u2019s heart vibrating and playing its little foolish tunes over and over again. We do not hear that Memnon\u2019s statue gave forth its melody at all under the rushing of the mightiest wind, or in response to any other influence divine or human than certain short-lived sunbeams of morning; and we must learn to accommodate ourselves to the discovery that some of those cunningly fashioned instruments called human souls have only a very limited range of music, and will not vibrate in the least under a touch that fills others with tremulous rapture or quivering agony. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty was quite used to the thought that people liked to look at her. She was not blind to the fact that young Luke Britton of Broxton came to Hayslope Church on a Sunday afternoon on purpose that he might see her; and that he would have made much more decided advances if her uncle Poyser, thinking but lightly of a young man whose father\u2019s land was so foul as old Luke Britton\u2019s, had not forbidden her aunt to encourage him by any civilities. She was aware, too, that Mr. Craig, the gardener at the Chase, was over head and ears in love with her, and had lately made unmistakable avowals in luscious strawberries and hyperbolical peas. She knew still better, that Adam Bede\u2014tall, upright, clever, brave Adam Bede\u2014who carried such authority with all the people round about, and whom her uncle was always delighted to see of an evening, saying that \u201cAdam knew a fine sight more o\u2019 the natur o\u2019 things than those as thought themselves his betters\u201d\u2014she knew that this Adam, who was often rather stern to other people and not much given to run after the lasses, could be made to turn pale or red any day by a word or a look from her. Hetty\u2019s sphere of comparison was not large, but she couldn\u2019t help perceiving that Adam was \u201csomething like\u201d a man; always knew what to say about things, could tell her uncle how to prop the hovel, and had mended the churn in no time; knew, with only looking at it, the value of the chestnut-tree that was blown down, and why the damp came in the walls, and what they must do to stop the rats; and wrote a beautiful hand that you could read off, and could do figures in his head\u2014a degree of accomplishment totally unknown among the richest farmers of that countryside. Not at all like that slouching Luke Britton, who, when she once walked with him all the way from Broxton to Hayslope, had only broken silence to remark that the grey goose had begun to lay. And as for Mr. Craig, the gardener, he was a sensible man enough, to be sure, but he was knock-kneed, and had a queer sort of sing-song in his talk; moreover, on the most charitable supposition, he must be far on the way to forty. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty was quite certain her uncle wanted her to encourage Adam, and would be pleased for her to marry him. For those were times when there was no rigid demarcation of rank between the farmer and the respectable artisan, and on the home hearth, as well as in the public house, they might be seen taking their jug of ale together; the farmer having a latent sense of capital, and of weight in parish affairs, which sustained him under his conspicuous inferiority in conversation. Martin Poyser was not a frequenter of public houses, but he liked a friendly chat over his own home-brewed; and though it was pleasant to lay down the law to a stupid neighbour who had no notion how to make the best of his farm, it was also an agreeable variety to learn something from a clever fellow like Adam Bede. Accordingly, for the last three years\u2014ever since he had superintended the building of the new barn\u2014Adam had always been made welcome at the Hall Farm, especially of a winter evening, when the whole family, in patriarchal fashion, master and mistress, children and servants, were assembled in that glorious kitchen, at well-graduated distances from the blazing fire. And for the last two years, at least, Hetty had been in the habit of hearing her uncle say, \u201cAdam Bede may be working for wage now, but he\u2019ll be a master-man some day, as sure as I sit in this chair. Mester Burge is in the right on\u2019t to want him to go partners and marry his daughter, if it\u2019s true what they say; the woman as marries him \u2019ull have a good take, be\u2019t Lady day or Michaelmas,\u201d a remark which Mrs. Poyser always followed up with her cordial assent. \u201cAh,\u201d she would say, \u201cit\u2019s all very fine having a ready-made rich man, but mayhappen he\u2019ll be a ready-made fool; and it\u2019s no use filling your pocket full o\u2019 money if you\u2019ve got a hole in the corner. It\u2019ll do you no good to sit in a spring-cart o\u2019 your own, if you\u2019ve got a soft to drive you: he\u2019ll soon turn you over into the ditch. I allays said I\u2019d never marry a man as had got no brains; for where\u2019s the use of a woman having brains of her own if she\u2019s tackled to a geck as everybody\u2019s a-laughing at? She might as well dress herself fine to sit back\u2019ards on a donkey.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  These expressions, though figurative, sufficiently indicated the bent of Mrs. Poyser\u2019s mind with regard to Adam; and though she and her husband might have viewed the subject differently if Hetty had been a daughter of their own, it was clear that they would have welcomed the match with Adam for a penniless niece. For what could Hetty have been but a servant elsewhere, if her uncle had not taken her in and brought her up as a domestic help to her aunt, whose health since the birth of Totty had not been equal to more positive labour than the superintendence of servants and children? But Hetty had never given Adam any steady encouragement. Even in the moments when she was most thoroughly conscious of his superiority to her other admirers, she had never brought herself to think of accepting him. She liked to feel that this strong, skilful, keen-eyed man was in her power, and would have been indignant if he had shown the least sign of slipping from under the yoke of her coquettish tyranny and attaching himself to the gentle Mary Burge, who would have been grateful enough for the most trifling notice from him. \u201cMary Burge, indeed! Such a sallow-faced girl: if she put on a bit of pink ribbon, she looked as yellow as a crow-flower and her hair was as straight as a hank of cotton.\u201d And always when Adam stayed away for several weeks from the Hall Farm, and otherwise made some show of resistance to his passion as a foolish one, Hetty took care to entice him back into the net by little airs of meekness and timidity, as if she were in trouble at his neglect. But as to marrying Adam, that was a very different affair! There was nothing in the world to tempt her to do that. Her cheeks never grew a shade deeper when his name was mentioned; she felt no thrill when she saw him passing along the causeway by the window, or advancing towards her unexpectedly in the footpath across the meadow; she felt nothing, when his eyes rested on her, but the cold triumph of knowing that he loved her and would not care to look at Mary Burge. He could no more stir in her the emotions that make the sweet intoxication of young love than the mere picture of a sun can stir the spring sap in the subtle fibres of the plant. She saw him as he was\u2014a poor man with old parents to keep, who would not be able, for a long while to come, to give her even such luxuries as she shared in her uncle\u2019s house. And Hetty\u2019s dreams were all of luxuries: to sit in a carpeted parlour, and always wear white stockings; to have some large beautiful ear-rings, such as were all the fashion; to have Nottingham lace round the top of her gown, and something to make her handkerchief smell nice, like Miss Lydia Donnithorne\u2019s when she drew it out at church; and not to be obliged to get up early or be scolded by anybody. She thought, if Adam had been rich and could have given her these things, she loved him well enough to marry him. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  But for the last few weeks a new influence had come over Hetty\u2014vague, atmospheric, shaping itself into no self-confessed hopes or prospects, but producing a pleasant narcotic effect, making her tread the ground and go about her work in a sort of dream, unconscious of weight or effort, and showing her all things through a soft, liquid veil, as if she were living not in this solid world of brick and stone, but in a beatified world, such as the sun lights up for us in the waters. Hetty had become aware that Mr. Arthur Donnithorne would take a good deal of trouble for the chance of seeing her; that he always placed himself at church so as to have the fullest view of her both sitting and standing; that he was constantly finding reason for calling at the Hall Farm, and always would contrive to say something for the sake of making her speak to him and look at him. The poor child no more conceived at present the idea that the young squire could ever be her lover than a baker\u2019s pretty daughter in the crowd, whom a young emperor distinguishes by an imperial but admiring smile, conceives that she shall be made empress. But the baker\u2019s daughter goes home and dreams of the handsome young emperor, and perhaps weighs the flour amiss while she is thinking what a heavenly lot it must be to have him for a husband. And so, poor Hetty had got a face and a presence haunting her waking and sleeping dreams; bright, soft glances had penetrated her, and suffused her life with a strange, happy languor. The eyes that shed those glances were really not half so fine as Adam\u2019s, which sometimes looked at her with a sad, beseeching tenderness, but they had found a ready medium in Hetty\u2019s little silly imagination, whereas Adam\u2019s could get no entrance through that atmosphere. For three weeks, at least, her inward life had consisted of little else than living through in memory the looks and words Arthur had directed towards her\u2014of little else than recalling the sensations with which she heard his voice outside the house, and saw him enter, and became conscious that his eyes were fixed on her, and then became conscious that a tall figure, looking down on her with eyes that seemed to touch her, was coming nearer in clothes of beautiful texture with an odour like that of a flower-garden borne on the evening breeze. Foolish thoughts! But all this happened, you must remember, nearly sixty years ago, and Hetty was quite uneducated\u2014a simple farmer\u2019s girl, to whom a gentleman with a white hand was dazzling as an Olympian god. Until to-day, she had never looked farther into the future than to the next time Captain Donnithorne would come to the Farm, or the next Sunday when she should see him at church; but now she thought, perhaps he would try to meet her when she went to the Chase to-morrow\u2014and if he should speak to her, and walk a little way, when nobody was by! That had never happened yet; and now her imagination, instead of retracing the past, was busy fashioning what would happen to-morrow\u2014whereabout in the Chase she should see him coming towards her, how she should put her new rose-coloured ribbon on, which he had never seen, and what he would say to her to make her return his glance\u2014a glance which she would be living through in her memory, over and over again, all the rest of the day. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  In this state of mind, how could Hetty give any feeling to Adam\u2019s troubles, or think much about poor old Thias being drowned? Young souls, in such pleasant delirium as hers are as unsympathetic as butterflies sipping nectar; they are isolated from all appeals by a barrier of dreams\u2014by invisible looks and impalpable arms. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  While Hetty\u2019s hands were busy packing up the butter, and her head filled with these pictures of the morrow, Arthur Donnithorne, riding by Mr. Irwine\u2019s side towards the valley of the Willow Brook, had also certain indistinct anticipations, running as an undercurrent in his mind while he was listening to Mr. Irwine\u2019s account of Dinah\u2014indistinct, yet strong enough to make him feel rather conscious when Mr. Irwine suddenly said, \u201cWhat fascinated you so in Mrs. Poyser\u2019s dairy, Arthur? Have you become an amateur of damp quarries and skimming dishes?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur knew the rector too well to suppose that a clever invention would be of any use, so he said, with his accustomed frankness, \u201cNo, I went to look at the pretty butter-maker Hetty Sorrel. She\u2019s a perfect Hebe; and if I were an artist, I would paint her. It\u2019s amazing what pretty girls one sees among the farmers\u2019 daughters, when the men are such clowns. That common, round, red face one sees sometimes in the men\u2014all cheek and no features, like Martin Poyser\u2019s\u2014comes out in the women of the family as the most charming phiz imaginable.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, I have no objection to your contemplating Hetty in an artistic light, but I must not have you feeding her vanity and filling her little noddle with the notion that she\u2019s a great beauty, attractive to fine gentlemen, or you will spoil her for a poor man\u2019s wife\u2014honest Craig\u2019s, for example, whom I have seen bestowing soft glances on her. The little puss seems already to have airs enough to make a husband as miserable as it\u2019s a law of nature for a quiet man to be when he marries a beauty. Apropos of marrying, I hope our friend Adam will get settled, now the poor old man\u2019s gone. He will only have his mother to keep in future, and I\u2019ve a notion that there\u2019s a kindness between him and that nice modest girl, Mary Burge, from something that fell from old Jonathan one day when I was talking to him. But when I mentioned the subject to Adam he looked uneasy and turned the conversation. I suppose the love-making doesn\u2019t run smooth, or perhaps Adam hangs back till he\u2019s in a better position. He has independence of spirit enough for two men\u2014rather an excess of pride, if anything.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat would be a capital match for Adam. He would slip into old Burge\u2019s shoes and make a fine thing of that building business, I\u2019ll answer for him. I should like to see him well settled in this parish; he would be ready then to act as my grand-vizier when I wanted one. We could plan no end of repairs and improvements together. I\u2019ve never seen the girl, though, I think\u2014at least I\u2019ve never looked at her.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLook at her next Sunday at church\u2014she sits with her father on the left of the reading-desk. You needn\u2019t look quite so much at Hetty Sorrel then. When I\u2019ve made up my mind that I can\u2019t afford to buy a tempting dog, I take no notice of him, because if he took a strong fancy to me and looked lovingly at me, the struggle between arithmetic and inclination might become unpleasantly severe. I pique myself on my wisdom there, Arthur, and as an old fellow to whom wisdom had become cheap, I bestow it upon you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThank you. It may stand me in good stead some day though I don\u2019t know that I have any present use for it. Bless me! How the brook has overflowed.

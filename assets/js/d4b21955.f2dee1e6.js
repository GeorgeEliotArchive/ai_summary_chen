There was no sunshine, but the clouds were high, and the wind was so still that the yellow leaves which fluttered down from the hedgerow elms must have fallen from pure decay. Nevertheless, Mrs. Poyser did not go to church, for she had taken a cold too serious to be neglected; only two winters ago she had been laid up for weeks with a cold; and since his wife did not go to church, Mr. Poyser considered that on the whole it would be as well for him to stay away too and \u201ckeep her company.\u201d He could perhaps have given no precise form to the reasons that determined this conclusion, but it is well known to all experienced minds that our firmest convictions are often dependent on subtle impressions for which words are quite too coarse a medium. However it was, no one from the Poyser family went to church that afternoon except Hetty and the boys; yet Adam was bold enough to join them after church, and say that he would walk home with them, though all the way through the village he appeared to be chiefly occupied with Marty and Tommy, telling them about the squirrels in Binton Coppice, and promising to take them there some day. But when they came to the fields he said to the boys, \u201cNow, then, which is the stoutest walker? Him as gets to th\u2019 home-gate first shall be the first to go with me to Binton Coppice on the donkey. But Tommy must have the start up to the next stile, because he\u2019s the smallest.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam had never behaved so much like a determined lover before. As soon as the boys had both set off, he looked down at Hetty and said, \u201cWon\u2019t you hang on my arm, Hetty?\u201d in a pleading tone, as if he had already asked her and she had refused. Hetty looked up at him smilingly and put her round arm through his in a moment. It was nothing to her, putting her arm through Adam\u2019s, but she knew he cared a great deal about having her arm through his, and she wished him to care. Her heart beat no faster, and she looked at the half-bare hedgerows and the ploughed field with the same sense of oppressive dulness as before. But Adam scarcely felt that he was walking. He thought Hetty must know that he was pressing her arm a little\u2014a very little. Words rushed to his lips that he dared not utter\u2014that he had made up his mind not to utter yet\u2014and so he was silent for the length of that field. The calm patience with which he had once waited for Hetty\u2019s love, content only with her presence and the thought of the future, had forsaken him since that terrible shock nearly three months ago. The agitations of jealousy had given a new restlessness to his passion\u2014had made fear and uncertainty too hard almost to bear. But though he might not speak to Hetty of his love, he would tell her about his new prospects and see if she would be pleased. So when he was enough master of himself to talk, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell your uncle some news that\u2019ll surprise him, Hetty; and I think he\u2019ll be glad to hear it too.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Hetty said indifferently. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, Mr. Burge has offered me a share in his business, and I\u2019m going to take it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There was a change in Hetty\u2019s face, certainly not produced by any agreeable impression from this news. In fact she felt a momentary annoyance and alarm, for she had so often heard it hinted by her uncle that Adam might have Mary Burge and a share in the business any day, if he liked, that she associated the two objects now, and the thought immediately occurred that perhaps Adam had given her up because of what had happened lately, and had turned towards Mary Burge. With that thought, and before she had time to remember any reasons why it could not be true, came a new sense of forsakenness and disappointment. The one thing\u2014the one person\u2014her mind had rested on in its dull weariness, had slipped away from her, and peevish misery filled her eyes with tears. She was looking on the ground, but Adam saw her face, saw the tears, and before he had finished saying, \u201cHetty, dear Hetty, what are you crying for?\u201d his eager rapid thought had flown through all the causes conceivable to him, and had at last alighted on half the true one. Hetty thought he was going to marry Mary Burge\u2014she didn\u2019t like him to marry\u2014perhaps she didn\u2019t like him to marry any one but herself? All caution was swept away\u2014all reason for it was gone, and Adam could feel nothing but trembling joy. He leaned towards her and took her hand, as he said: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI could afford to be married now, Hetty\u2014I could make a wife comfortable; but I shall never want to be married if you won\u2019t have me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty looked up at him and smiled through her tears, as she had done to Arthur that first evening in the wood, when she had thought he was not coming, and yet he came. It was a feebler relief, a feebler triumph she felt now, but the great dark eyes and the sweet lips were as beautiful as ever, perhaps more beautiful, for there was a more luxuriant womanliness about Hetty of late. Adam could hardly believe in the happiness of that moment. His right hand held her left, and he pressed her arm close against his heart as he leaned down towards her. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDo you really love me, Hetty? Will you be my own wife, to love and take care of as long as I live?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty did not speak, but Adam\u2019s face was very close to hers, and she put up her round cheek against his, like a kitten. She wanted to be caressed\u2014she wanted to feel as if Arthur were with her again. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam cared for no words after that, and they hardly spoke through the rest of the walk. He only said, \u201cI may tell your uncle and aunt, mayn\u2019t I, Hetty?\u201d and she said, \u201cYes.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The red fire-light on the hearth at the Hall Farm shone on joyful faces that evening, when Hetty was gone upstairs and Adam took the opportunity of telling Mr. and Mrs. Poyser and the grandfather that he saw his way to maintaining a wife now, and that Hetty had consented to have him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI hope you have no objections against me for her husband,\u201d said Adam; \u201cI\u2019m a poor man as yet, but she shall want nothing as I can work for.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cObjections?\u201d said Mr. Poyser, while the grandfather leaned forward and brought out his long \u201cNay, nay.\u201d \u201cWhat objections can we ha\u2019 to you, lad? Never mind your being poorish as yet; there\u2019s money in your head-piece as there\u2019s money i\u2019 the sown field, but it must ha\u2019 time. You\u2019n got enough to begin on, and we can do a deal tow\u2019rt the bit o\u2019 furniture you\u2019ll want. Thee\u2019st got feathers and linen to spare\u2014plenty, eh?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  This question was of course addressed to Mrs. Poyser, who was wrapped up in a warm shawl and was too hoarse to speak with her usual facility. At first she only nodded emphatically, but she was presently unable to resist the temptation to be more explicit. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt ud be a poor tale if I hadna feathers and linen,\u201d she said, hoarsely, \u201cwhen I never sell a fowl but what\u2019s plucked, and the wheel\u2019s a-going every day o\u2019 the week.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCome, my wench,\u201d said Mr. Poyser, when Hetty came down, \u201ccome and kiss us, and let us wish you luck.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty went very quietly and kissed the big good-natured man. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere!\u201d he said, patting her on the back, \u201cgo and kiss your aunt and your grandfather. I\u2019m as wishful t\u2019 have you settled well as if you was my own daughter; and so\u2019s your aunt, I\u2019ll be bound, for she\u2019s done by you this seven \u2019ear, Hetty, as if you\u2019d been her own. Come, come, now,\u201d he went on, becoming jocose, as soon as Hetty had kissed her aunt and the old man, \u201cAdam wants a kiss too, I\u2019ll warrant, and he\u2019s a right to one now.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty turned away, smiling, towards her empty chair. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCome, Adam, then, take one,\u201d persisted Mr. Poyser, \u201celse y\u2019 arena half a man.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam got up, blushing like a small maiden\u2014great strong fellow as he was\u2014and, putting his arm round Hetty stooped down and gently kissed her lips. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It was a pretty scene in the red fire-light; for there were no candles\u2014why should there be, when the fire was so bright and was reflected from all the pewter and the polished oak? No one wanted to work on a Sunday evening. Even Hetty felt something like contentment in the midst of all this love. Adam\u2019s attachment to her, Adam\u2019s caress, stirred no passion in her, were no longer enough to satisfy her vanity, but they were the best her life offered her now\u2014they promised her some change. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There was a great deal of discussion before Adam went away, about the possibility of his finding a house that would do for him to settle in. No house was empty except the one next to Will Maskery\u2019s in the village, and that was too small for Adam now. Mr. Poyser insisted that the best plan would be for Seth and his mother to move and leave Adam in the old home, which might be enlarged after a while, for there was plenty of space in the woodyard and garden; but Adam objected to turning his mother out. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, well,\u201d said Mr. Poyser at last, \u201cwe needna fix everything to-night. We must take time to consider. You canna think o\u2019 getting married afore Easter.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Sir Hugo Mallinger was not so prompt in starting for Genoa as Mr. Gascoigne had been, and Deronda on all accounts would not take his departure until he had seen the baronet. There was not only Grandcourt\u2019s death, but also the late crisis in his own life to make reasons why his oldest friend would desire to have the unrestrained communication of speech with him, for in writing he had not felt able to give any details concerning the mother who had come and gone like an apparition. It was not till the fifth evening that Deronda, according to telegram, waited for Sir Hugo at the station, where he was to arrive between eight and nine; and while he was looking forward to the sight of the kind, familiar face, which was part of his earliest memories, something like a smile, in spite of his late tragic experience, might have been detected in his eyes and the curve of his lips at the idea of Sir Hugo\u2019s pleasure in being now master of his estates, able to leave them to his daughters, or at least\u2014according to a view of inheritance which had just been strongly impressed on Deronda\u2019s imagination\u2014to take makeshift feminine offspring as intermediate to a satisfactory heir in a grandson. We should be churlish creatures if we could have no joy in our fellow-mortals\u2019 joy, unless it were in agreement with our theory of righteous distribution and our highest ideal of human good: what sour corners our mouths would get\u2014our eyes, what frozen glances! and all the while our own possessions and desires would not exactly adjust themselves to our ideal. We must have some comradeship with imperfection; and it is, happily, possible to feel gratitude even where we discern a mistake that may have been injurious, the vehicle of the mistake being an affectionate intention prosecuted through a life-time of kindly offices. Deronda\u2019s feeling and judgment were strongly against the action of Sir Hugo in making himself the agent of a falsity\u2014yes, a falsity: he could give no milder name to the concealment under which he had been reared. But the baronet had probably had no clear knowledge concerning the mother\u2019s breach of trust, and with his light, easy way of taking life, had held it a reasonable preference in her that her son should be made an English gentleman, seeing that she had the eccentricity of not caring to part from her child, and be to him as if she were not. Daniel\u2019s affectionate gratitude toward Sir Hugo made him wish to find grounds of excuse rather than blame; for it is as possible to be rigid in principle and tender in blame, as it is to suffer from the sight of things hung awry, and yet to be patient with the hanger who sees amiss. If Sir Hugo in his bachelorhood had been beguiled into regarding children chiefly as a product intended to make life more agreeable to the full-grown, whose convenience alone was to be consulted in the disposal of them\u2014why, he had shared an assumption which, if not formally avowed, was massively acted on at that date of the world\u2019s history; and Deronda, with all his keen memory of the painful inward struggle he had gone through in his boyhood, was able also to remember the many signs that his experience had been entirely shut out from Sir Hugo\u2019s conception. Ignorant kindness may have the effect of cruelty; but to be angry with it as if it were direct cruelty would be an ignorant _un_kindness, the most remote from Deronda\u2019s large imaginative lenience toward others. And perhaps now, after the searching scenes of the last ten days, in which the curtain had been lifted for him from the secrets of lives unlike his own, he was more than ever disposed to check that rashness of indignation or resentment which has an unpleasant likeness to the love of punishing. When he saw Sir Hugo\u2019s familiar figure descending from the railway carriage, the life-long affection which had been well accustomed to make excuses, flowed in and submerged all newer knowledge that might have seemed fresh ground for blame. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cWell, Dan,\u201d said Sir Hugo, with a serious fervor, grasping Deronda\u2019s hand.

The boy is to take his father\u2019s name; he is Henleigh already, and he is to be Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt. The Mallinger will be of no use to him, I am happy to say; but the young dog will have more than enough with his fourteen years\u2019 minority\u2014no need to have had holes filled up with my fifty thousand for Diplow that he had no right to: and meanwhile my beauty, the young widow, is to put up with a poor two thousand a year and the house at Gadsmere\u2014a nice kind of banishment for her if she chose to shut herself up there, which I don\u2019t think she will. The boy\u2019s mother has been living there of late years. I\u2019m perfectly disgusted with Grandcourt. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m obliged to think the better of him because he\u2019s drowned, though, so far as my affairs are concerned, nothing in his life became him like the leaving it.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cIn my opinion he did wrong when he married this wife\u2014not in leaving his estates to the son,\u201d said Deronda, rather dryly.

She ought to have had four or five thousand a year and the London house for her life; that\u2019s what I should have done for her. I suppose, as she was penniless, her friends couldn\u2019t stand out for a settlement, else it\u2019s ill trusting to the will a man may make after he\u2019s married. Even a wise man generally lets some folly ooze out of him in his will\u2014my father did, I know; and if a fellow has any spite or tyranny in him, he\u2019s likely to bottle off a good deal for keeping in that sort of document.

But I fancy you are the man who knew most about what Mrs. Grandcourt felt or did not feel\u2014eh, Dan?\u201d Sir Hugo did not put this question with his usual jocoseness, but rather with a lowered tone of interested inquiry; and Deronda felt that any evasion would be misinterpreted.

When that tremendous telegram came, the first thing Lady Mallinger said was, \u2018How very strange that it should be Daniel who sends it!\u2019 But I have had something of the same sort in my own life. I was once at a foreign hotel where a lady had been left by her husband without money. When I heard of it, and came forward to help her, who should she be but an early flame of mine, who had been fool enough to marry an Austrian baron with a long mustache and short affection?

Sir Hugo had begun to talk of the Grandcourts as the less difficult subject between himself and Deronda; but they were both wishing to overcome a reluctance to perfect frankness on the events which touched their relation to each other. Deronda felt that his letter, after the first interview with his mother, had been rather a thickening than a breaking of the ice, and that he ought to wait for the first opening to come from Sir Hugo. Just when they were about to lose sight of the port, the baronet turned, and pausing as if to get a last view, said in a tone of more serious feeling\u2014\u201cAnd about the main business of your coming to Genoa, Dan?

But it is no pain\u2014it is rather a clearing up of doubts for which I am thankful, to know my parentage. As to the effect on my position, there will be no change in my gratitude to you, sir, for the fatherly care and affection you have always shown me.

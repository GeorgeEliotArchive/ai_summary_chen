In both of them, the concentration in the present which had attended the first moments of Arthur\u2019s revival had now given way to a vivid recollection of the previous scene. It was nearly dark in the narrow path among the trees, but within the circle of fir-trees round the Hermitage there was room for the growing moonlight to enter in at the windows. Their steps were noiseless on the thick carpet of fir-needles, and the outward stillness seemed to heighten their inward consciousness, as Arthur took the key out of his pocket and placed it in Adam\u2019s hand, for him to open the door. Adam had not known before that Arthur had furnished the old Hermitage and made it a retreat for himself, and it was a surprise to him when he opened the door to see a snug room with all the signs of frequent habitation. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur loosed Adam\u2019s arm and threw himself on the ottoman. \u201cYou\u2019ll see my hunting-bottle somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cA leather case with a bottle and glass in.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam was not long in finding the case. \u201cThere\u2019s very little brandy in it, sir,\u201d he said, turning it downwards over the glass, as he held it before the window; \u201chardly this little glassful.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, give me that,\u201d said Arthur, with the peevishness of physical depression. When he had taken some sips, Adam said, \u201cHadn\u2019t I better run to th\u2019 house, sir, and get some more brandy? I can be there and back pretty soon. It\u2019ll be a stiff walk home for you, if you don\u2019t have something to revive you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes\u2014go. But don\u2019t say I\u2019m ill. Ask for my man Pym, and tell him to get it from Mills, and not to say I\u2019m at the Hermitage. Get some water too.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam was relieved to have an active task\u2014both of them were relieved to be apart from each other for a short time. But Adam\u2019s swift pace could not still the eager pain of thinking\u2014of living again with concentrated suffering through the last wretched hour, and looking out from it over all the new sad future. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur lay still for some minutes after Adam was gone, but presently he rose feebly from the ottoman and peered about slowly in the broken moonlight, seeking something. It was a short bit of wax candle that stood amongst a confusion of writing and drawing materials. There was more searching for the means of lighting the candle, and when that was done, he went cautiously round the room, as if wishing to assure himself of the presence or absence of something. At last he had found a slight thing, which he put first in his pocket, and then, on a second thought, took out again and thrust deep down into a waste-paper basket. It was a woman\u2019s little, pink, silk neckerchief. He set the candle on the table, and threw himself down on the ottoman again, exhausted with the effort. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  When Adam came back with his supplies, his entrance awoke Arthur from a doze. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Arthur said; \u201cI\u2019m tremendously in want of some brandy-vigour.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019ve got a light, sir,\u201d said Adam. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking I\u2019d better have asked for a lanthorn.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, no; the candle will last long enough\u2014I shall soon be up to walking home now.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI can\u2019t go before I\u2019ve seen you safe home, sir,\u201d said Adam, hesitatingly. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo: it will be better for you to stay\u2014sit down.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam sat down, and they remained opposite to each other in uneasy silence, while Arthur slowly drank brandy-and-water, with visibly renovating effect. He began to lie in a more voluntary position, and looked as if he were less overpowered by bodily sensations. Adam was keenly alive to these indications, and as his anxiety about Arthur\u2019s condition began to be allayed, he felt more of that impatience which every one knows who has had his just indignation suspended by the physical state of the culprit. Yet there was one thing on his mind to be done before he could recur to remonstrance: it was to confess what had been unjust in his own words. Perhaps he longed all the more to make this confession, that his indignation might be free again; and as he saw the signs of returning ease in Arthur, the words again and again came to his lips and went back, checked by the thought that it would be better to leave everything till to-morrow. As long as they were silent they did not look at each other, and a foreboding came across Adam that if they began to speak as though they remembered the past\u2014if they looked at each other with full recognition\u2014they must take fire again. So they sat in silence till the bit of wax candle flickered low in the socket, the silence all the while becoming more irksome to Adam. Arthur had just poured out some more brandy-and-water, and he threw one arm behind his head and drew up one leg in an attitude of recovered ease, which was an irresistible temptation to Adam to speak what was on his mind. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou begin to feel more yourself again, sir,\u201d he said, as the candle went out and they were half-hidden from each other in the faint moonlight. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes: I don\u2019t feel good for much\u2014very lazy, and not inclined to move; but I\u2019ll go home when I\u2019ve taken this dose.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  There was a slight pause before Adam said, \u201cMy temper got the better of me, and I said things as wasn\u2019t true. I\u2019d no right to speak as if you\u2019d known you was doing me an injury: you\u2019d no grounds for knowing it; I\u2019ve always kept what I felt for her as secret as I could.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He paused again before he went on. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd perhaps I judged you too harsh\u2014I\u2019m apt to be harsh\u2014and you may have acted out o\u2019 thoughtlessness more than I should ha\u2019 believed was possible for a man with a heart and a conscience. We\u2019re not all put together alike, and we may misjudge one another. God knows, it\u2019s all the joy I could have now, to think the best of you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur wanted to go home without saying any more\u2014he was too painfully embarrassed in mind, as well as too weak in body, to wish for any further explanation to-night. And yet it was a relief to him that Adam reopened the subject in a way the least difficult for him to answer. Arthur was in the wretched position of an open, generous man who has committed an error which makes deception seem a necessity. The native impulse to give truth in return for truth, to meet trust with frank confession, must be suppressed, and duty was becoming a question of tactics. His deed was reacting upon him\u2014was already governing him tyrannously and forcing him into a course that jarred with his habitual feelings. The only aim that seemed admissible to him now was to deceive Adam to the utmost: to make Adam think better of him than he deserved. And when he heard the words of honest retractation\u2014when he heard the sad appeal with which Adam ended\u2014he was obliged to rejoice in the remains of ignorant confidence it implied. He did not answer immediately, for he had to be judicious and not truthful. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSay no more about our anger, Adam,\u201d he said, at last, very languidly, for the labour of speech was unwelcome to him; \u201cI forgive your momentary injustice\u2014it was quite natural, with the exaggerated notions you had in your mind. We shall be none the worse friends in future, I hope, because we\u2019ve fought. You had the best of it, and that was as it should be, for I believe I\u2019ve been most in the wrong of the two. Come, let us shake hands.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur held out his hand, but Adam sat still. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI don\u2019t like to say \u2018No\u2019 to that, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t shake hands till it\u2019s clear what we mean by\u2019t. I was wrong when I spoke as if you\u2019d done me an injury knowingly, but I wasn\u2019t wrong in what I said before, about your behaviour t\u2019 Hetty, and I can\u2019t shake hands with you as if I held you my friend the same as ever till you\u2019ve cleared that up better.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Arthur swallowed his pride and resentment as he drew back his hand. He was silent for some moments, and then said, as indifferently as he could, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by clearing up, Adam. I\u2019ve told you already that you think too seriously of a little flirtation. But if you are right in supposing there is any danger in it\u2014I\u2019m going away on Saturday, and there will be an end of it. As for the pain it has given you, I\u2019m heartily sorry for it. I can say no more.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam said nothing, but rose from his chair and stood with his face towards one of the windows, as if looking at the blackness of the moonlit fir-trees; but he was in reality conscious of nothing but the conflict within him. It was of no use now\u2014his resolution not to speak till to-morrow. He must speak there and then. But it was several minutes before he turned round and stepped nearer to Arthur, standing and looking down on him as he lay. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019ll be better for me to speak plain,\u201d he said, with evident effort, \u201cthough it\u2019s hard work. You see, sir, this isn\u2019t a trifle to me, whatever it may be to you. I\u2019m none o\u2019 them men as can go making love first to one woman and then t\u2019 another, and don\u2019t think it much odds which of \u2019em I take. What I feel for Hetty\u2019s a different sort o\u2019 love, such as I believe nobody can know much about but them as feel it and God as has given it to \u2019em. She\u2019s more nor everything else to me, all but my conscience and my good name. And if it\u2019s true what you\u2019ve been saying all along\u2014and if it\u2019s only been trifling and flirting as you call it, as \u2019ll be put an end to by your going away\u2014why, then, I\u2019d wait, and hope her heart \u2019ud turn to me after all. I\u2019m loath to think you\u2019d speak false to me, and I\u2019ll believe your word, however things may look.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou would be wronging Hetty more than me not to believe it,\u201d said Arthur, almost violently, starting up from the ottoman and moving away. But he threw himself into a chair again directly, saying, more feebly, \u201cYou seem to forget that, in suspecting me, you are casting imputations upon her.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, sir,\u201d Adam said, in a calmer voice, as if he were half-relieved\u2014for he was too straightforward to make a distinction between a direct falsehood and an indirect one\u2014\u201cNay, sir, things don\u2019t lie level between Hetty and you. You\u2019re acting with your eyes open, whatever you may do; but how do you know what\u2019s been in her mind? She\u2019s all but a child\u2014as any man with a conscience in him ought to feel bound to take care on. And whatever you may think, I know you\u2019ve disturbed her mind. I know she\u2019s been fixing her heart on you, for there\u2019s a many things clear to me now as I didn\u2019t understand before. But you seem to make light o\u2019 what ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"she")," may feel\u2014you don\u2019t think o\u2019 that.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGood God, Adam, let me alone!\u201d Arthur burst out impetuously; \u201cI feel it enough without your worrying me.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  He was aware of his indiscretion as soon as the words had escaped him. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, then, if you feel it,\u201d Adam rejoined, eagerly; \u201cif you feel as you may ha\u2019 put false notions into her mind, and made her believe as you loved her, when all the while you meant nothing, I\u2019ve this demand to make of you\u2014I\u2019m not speaking for myself, but for her. I ask you t\u2019 undeceive her before you go away. Y\u2019aren\u2019t going away for ever, and if you leave her behind with a notion in her head o\u2019 your feeling about her the same as she feels about you, she\u2019ll be hankering after you, and the mischief may get worse. It may be a smart to her now, but it\u2019ll save her pain i\u2019 th\u2019 end. I ask you to write a letter\u2014you may trust to my seeing as she gets it. Tell her the truth, and take blame to yourself for behaving as you\u2019d no right to do to a young woman as isn\u2019t your equal. I speak plain, sir, but I can\u2019t speak any other way.

Then Arthur said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you to-morrow. I can bear no more now; I\u2019m ill.\u201d He rose as he spoke, and reached his cap, as if intending to go.

Fear is almost always haunted by terrible dramatic scenes, which recur in spite of the best-argued probabilities against them; and during a year that Maggie had had the burthen of concealment on her mind, the possibility of discovery had continually presented itself under the form of a sudden meeting with her father or Tom when she was walking with Philip in the Red Deeps. She was aware that this was not one of the most likely events; but it was the scene that most completely symbolised her inward dread. Those slight indirect suggestions which are dependent on apparently trivial coincidences and incalculable states of mind, are the favourite machinery of Fact, but are not the stuff in which Imagination is apt to work. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Certainly one of the persons about whom Maggie\u2019s fears were furthest from troubling themselves was her aunt Pullet, on whom, seeing that she did not live in St Ogg\u2019s, and was neither sharp-eyed nor sharp-tempered, it would surely have been quite whimsical of them to fix rather than on aunt Glegg. And yet the channel of fatality\u2014the pathway of the lightning\u2014was no other than aunt Pullet. She did not live at St Ogg\u2019s, but the road from Garum Firs lay by the Red Deeps, at the end opposite that by which Maggie entered. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  The day after Maggie\u2019s last meeting with Philip, being a Sunday on which Mr Pullet was bound to appear in funeral hatband and scarf at St Ogg\u2019s church, Mrs Pullet made this the occasion of dining with sister Glegg, and taking tea with poor sister Tulliver. Sunday was the one day in the week on which Tom was at home in the afternoon; and today the brighter spirits he had been in of late had flowed over in unusually cheerful open chat with his father, and in the invitation, \u201cCome, Magsie, you come too!\u201d when he strolled out with his mother in the garden to see the advancing cherry-blossoms. He had been better pleased with Maggie since she had been less odd and ascetic; he was even getting rather proud of her; several persons had remarked in his hearing that his sister was a very fine girl. To-day there was a peculiar brightness in her face, due in reality to an undercurrent of excitement, which had as much doubt and pain as pleasure in it; but it might pass for a sign of happiness. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou look very well, my dear,\u201d said aunt Pullet, shaking her head sadly, as they sat round the tea-table. \u201cI niver thought your girl \u2019ud be so good-looking, Bessy.

Dear, dear! to think o\u2019 the property he\u2019s like to have; and they say he\u2019s very queer and lonely, doesn\u2019t like much company. I shouldn\u2019t wonder if he goes out of his mind; for we never come along the road but he\u2019s a-scrambling out o\u2019 the trees and brambles at the Red Deeps.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  This wide statement, by which Mrs Pullet represented the fact that she had twice seen Philip at the spot indicated, produced an effect on Maggie which was all the stronger because Tom sate opposite her, and she was intensely anxious to look indifferent. At Philip\u2019s name she had blushed, and the blush deepened every instant from consciousness, until the mention of the Red Deeps made her feel as if the whole secret were betrayed, and she dared not even hold her tea-spoon lest she should show how she trembled. She sat with her hands clasped under the table, not daring to look round. Happily, her father was seated on the same side with herself, beyond her uncle Pullet, and could not see her face without stooping forward. Her mother\u2019s voice brought the first relief, turning the conversation; for Mrs Tulliver was always alarmed when the name of Wakem was mentioned in her husband\u2019s presence. Gradually Maggie recovered composure enough to look up; her eyes met Tom\u2019s, but he turned away his head immediately; and she went to bed that night wondering if he had gathered any suspicion from her confusion. Perhaps not; perhaps he would think it was only her alarm at her aunt\u2019s mention of Wakem before her father; that was the interpretation her mother had put on it. To her father, Wakem was like a disfiguring disease, of which he was obliged to endure the consciousness, but was exasperated to have the existence recognised by others; and no amount of sensitiveness in her about her father could be surprising, Maggie thought. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  But Tom was too keen-sighted to rest satisfied with such an interpretation; he had seen clearly enough that there was something distinct from anxiety about her father in Maggie\u2019s excessive confusion. In trying to recall all the details that could give shape to his suspicions, he remembered only lately hearing his mother scold Maggie for walking in the Red Deeps when the ground was wet, and bringing home shoes clogged with red soil; still Tom, retaining all his old repulsion for Philip\u2019s deformity, shrank from attributing to his sister the probability of feeling more than a friendly interest in such an unfortunate exception to the common run of men. Tom\u2019s was a nature which had a sort of superstitious repugnance to everything exceptional. A love for a deformed man would be odious in any woman, in a sister intolerable. But if she had been carrying on any kind of intercourse whatever with Philip, a stop must be put to it at once; she was disobeying her father\u2019s strongest feelings and her brother\u2019s express commands, besides compromising herself by secret meetings. He left home the next morning in that watchful state of mind which turns the most ordinary course of things into pregnant coincidences. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  That afternoon, about half-past three o\u2019clock, Tom was standing on the wharf, talking with Bob Jakin about the probability of the good ship Adelaide coming in, in a day or two, with results highly important to both of them. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cEh,\u201d said Bob, parenthetically, as he looked over the fields on the other side of the river, \u201cthere goes that crooked young Wakem.

Maggie was suffering in anticipation of what Philip was about to suffer, and dreading the galling words that would fall on him from Tom\u2019s lips; but she felt it was in vain to attempt anything but submission. Tom had his terrible clutch on her conscience and her deepest dread; she writhed under the demonstrable truth of the character he had given to her conduct, and yet her whole soul rebelled against it as unfair from its incompleteness. He, meanwhile, felt the impetus of his indignation diverted toward Philip. He did not know how much of an old boyish repulsion and of mere personal pride and animosity was concerned in the bitter severity of the words by which he meant to do the duty of a son and a brother. Tom was not given to inquire subtly into his own motives any more than into other matters of an intangible kind; he was quite sure that his own motives as well as actions were good, else he would have had nothing to do with them. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie\u2019s only hope was that something might, for the first time, have prevented Philip from coming. Then there would be delay,\u2014then she might get Tom\u2019s permission to write to him. Her heart beat with double violence when they got under the Scotch firs. It was the last moment of suspense, she thought; Philip always met her soon after she got beyond them. But they passed across the more open green space, and entered the narrow bushy path by the mound. Another turning, and they came so close upon him that both Tom and Philip stopped suddenly within a yard of each other. There was a moment\u2019s silence, in which Philip darted a look of inquiry at Maggie\u2019s face. He saw an answer there, in the pale, parted lips, and the terrified tension of the large eyes. Her imagination, always rushing extravagantly beyond an immediate impression, saw her tall, strong brother grasping the feeble Philip bodily, crushing him and trampling on him. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDo you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?\u201d Tom said, in a voice of harsh scorn, as soon as Philip\u2019s eyes were turned on him again. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d answered Philip, haughtily. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMean? Stand farther from me, lest I should lay hands on you, and I\u2019ll tell you what I mean. I mean, taking advantage of a young girl\u2019s foolishness and ignorance to get her to have secret meetings with you. I mean, daring to trifle with the respectability of a family that has a good and honest name to support.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI deny that,\u201d interrupted Philip, impetuously. \u201cI could never trifle with anything that affected your sister\u2019s happiness. She is dearer to me than she is to you; I honour her more than you can ever honour her; I would give up my life to her.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t talk high-flown nonsense to me, sir! Do you mean to pretend that you didn\u2019t know it would be injurious to her to meet you here week after week? Do you pretend you had any right to make professions of love to her, even if you had been a fit husband for her, when neither her father nor your father would ever consent to a marriage between you? And ",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you"),",\u2014",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you")," to try and worm yourself into the affections of a handsome girl who is not eighteen, and has been shut out from the world by her father\u2019s misfortunes! That\u2019s your crooked notion of honour, is it? I call it base treachery; I call it taking advantage of circumstances to win what\u2019s too good for you,\u2014what you\u2019d never get by fair means.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt is manly of you to talk in this way to ",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"me"),",\u201d said Philip, bitterly, his whole frame shaken by violent emotions. \u201cGiants have an immemorial right to stupidity and insolent abuse. You are incapable even of understanding what I feel for your sister. I feel so much for her that I could even desire to be at friendship with ",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you"),".\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI should be very sorry to understand your feelings,\u201d said Tom, with scorching contempt. \u201cWhat I wish is that you should understand ",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"me"),",\u2014that I shall take care of ",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"my")," sister, and that if you dare to make the least attempt to come near her, or to write to her, or to keep the slightest hold on her mind, your puny, miserable body, that ought to have put some modesty into your mind, shall not protect you. I\u2019ll thrash you; I\u2019ll hold you up to public scorn. Who wouldn\u2019t laugh at the idea of ",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"your")," turning lover to a fine girl?\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He burst out, in a convulsed voice. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cStay, Maggie!\u201d said Philip, making a strong effort to speak. Then looking at Tom, \u201cYou have dragged your sister here, I suppose, that she may stand by while you threaten and insult me. These naturally seemed to you the right means to influence me. But you are mistaken. Let your sister speak. If she says she is bound to give me up, I shall abide by her wishes to the slightest word.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt was for my father\u2019s sake, Philip,\u201d said Maggie, imploringly. \u201cTom threatens to tell my father, and he couldn\u2019t bear it; I have promised, I have vowed solemnly, that we will not have any intercourse without my brother\u2019s knowledge.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt is enough, Maggie. ",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I")," shall not change; but I wish you to hold yourself entirely free. But trust me; remember that I can never seek for anything but good to what belongs to you.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Tom, exasperated by this attitude of Philip\u2019s, \u201cyou can talk of seeking good for her and what belongs to her now; did you seek her good before?\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI did,\u2014at some risk, perhaps. But I wished her to have a friend for life,\u2014who would cherish her, who would do her more justice than a coarse and narrow-minded brother, that she has always lavished her affections on.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, my way of befriending her is different from yours; and I\u2019ll tell you what is my way. I\u2019ll save her from disobeying and disgracing her father; I\u2019ll save her from throwing herself away on you,\u2014from making herself a laughing-stock,\u2014from being flouted by a man like ",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"your")," father, because she\u2019s not good enough for his son. You know well enough what sort of justice and cherishing you were preparing for her. I\u2019m not to be imposed upon by fine words; I can see what actions mean. Come away, Maggie.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  He seized Maggie\u2019s right wrist as he spoke, and she put out her left hand. Philip clasped it an instant, with one eager look, and then hurried away. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He was still holding her wrist tightly, as if he were compelling a culprit from the scene of action. At last Maggie, with a violent snatch, drew her hand away, and her pent-up, long-gathered irritation burst into utterance. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t suppose that I think you are right, Tom, or that I bow to your will. I despise the feelings you have shown in speaking to Philip; I detest your insulting, unmanly allusions to his deformity. You have been reproaching other people all your life; you have been always sure you yourself are right. It is because you have not a mind large enough to see that there is anything better than your own conduct and your own petty aims.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Tom, coolly. \u201cI don\u2019t see that your conduct is better, or your aims either. If your conduct, and Philip Wakem\u2019s conduct, has been right, why are you ashamed of its being known? Answer me that. I know what I have aimed at in my conduct, and I\u2019ve succeeded; pray, what good has your conduct brought to you or any one else?\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI don\u2019t want to defend myself,\u201d said Maggie, still with vehemence: \u201cI know I\u2019ve been wrong,\u2014often, continually. But yet, sometimes when I have done wrong, it has been because I have feelings that you would be the better for, if you had them. If ",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you")," were in fault ever, if you had done anything very wrong, I should be sorry for the pain it brought you; I should not want punishment to be heaped on you. But you have always enjoyed punishing me; you have always been hard and cruel to me; even when I was a little girl, and always loved you better than any one else in the world, you would let me go crying to bed without forgiving me. You have no pity; you have no sense of your own imperfection and your own sins. It is a sin to be hard; it is not fitting for a mortal, for a Christian. You are nothing but a Pharisee. You thank God for nothing but your own virtues; you think they are great enough to win you everything else. You have not even a vision of feelings by the side of which your shining virtues are mere darkness!\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d said Tom, with cold scorn, \u201cif your feelings are so much better than mine, let me see you show them in some other way than by conduct that\u2019s likely to disgrace us all,\u2014than by ridiculous flights first into one extreme and then into another. Pray, how have you shown your love, that you talk of, either to me or my father? By disobeying and deceiving us. I have a different way of showing my affection.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBecause you are a man, Tom, and have power, and can do something in the world.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThen, if you can do nothing, submit to those that can.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSo I ",(0,a.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"will")," submit to what I acknowledge and feel to be right. I will submit even to what is unreasonable from my father, but I will not submit to it from you. You boast of your virtues as if they purchased you a right to be cruel and unmanly, as you\u2019ve been to-day. Don\u2019t suppose I would give up Philip Wakem in obedience to you. The deformity you insult would make me cling to him and care for him the more.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cVery well; that is your view of things.\u201d said Tom, more coldly than ever; \u201cyou need say no more to show me what a wide distance there is between us. Let us remember that in future, and be silent.\u201d "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Tom went back to St Ogg\u2019s, to fulfill an appointment with his uncle Deane, and receive directions about a journey on which he was to set out the next morning. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  Maggie went up to her own room to pour out all that indignant remonstrance, against which Tom\u2019s mind was close barred, in bitter tears. Then, when the first burst of unsatisfied anger was gone by, came the recollection of that quiet time before the pleasure which had ended in to-day\u2019s misery had perturbed the clearness and simplicity of her life. She used to think in that time that she had made great conquests, and won a lasting stand on serene heights above worldly temptations and conflict. And here she was down again in the thick of a hot strife with her own and others\u2019 passions. Life was not so short, then, and perfect rest was not so near as she had dreamed when she was two years younger. There was more struggle for her, and perhaps more falling. If she had felt that she was entirely wrong, and that Tom had been entirely right, she could sooner have recovered more inward harmony; but now her penitence and submission were constantly obstructed by resentment that would present itself to her no otherwise than as a just indignation. Her heart bled for Philip; she went on recalling the insults that had been flung at him with so vivid a conception of what he had felt under them, that it was almost like a sharp bodily pain to her, making her beat the floor with her foot and tighten her fingers on her palm. "),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"  And yet, how was it that she was now and then conscious of a certain dim background of relief in the forced separation from Philip? Surely it was only because the sense of a deliverance from concealment was welcome at any cost."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

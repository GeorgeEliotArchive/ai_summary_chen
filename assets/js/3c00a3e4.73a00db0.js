There was not any reason for thrusting the whole burden on Adam at once, and Mr. Irwine, at parting, only said, \u201cIf the evidence should tell too strongly against her, Adam, we may still hope for a pardon.

But he saw clearly that the secret must be known before long, even apart from Adam\u2019s determination, since it was scarcely to be supposed that Hetty would persist to the end in her obstinate silence. He made up his mind to withhold nothing from the Poysers, but to tell them the worst at once, for there was no time to rob the tidings of their suddenness. Hetty\u2019s trial must come on at the Lent assizes, and they were to be held at Stoniton the next week. It was scarcely to be hoped that Martin Poyser could escape the pain of being called as a witness, and it was better he should know everything as long beforehand as possible. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Before ten o\u2019clock on Thursday morning the home at the Hall Farm was a house of mourning for a misfortune felt to be worse than death. The sense of family dishonour was too keen even in the kind-hearted Martin Poyser the younger to leave room for any compassion towards Hetty. He and his father were simple-minded farmers, proud of their untarnished character, proud that they came of a family which had held up its head and paid its way as far back as its name was in the parish register; and Hetty had brought disgrace on them all\u2014disgrace that could never be wiped out. That was the all-conquering feeling in the mind both of father and son\u2014the scorching sense of disgrace, which neutralised all other sensibility\u2014and Mr. Irwine was struck with surprise to observe that Mrs. Poyser was less severe than her husband.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  On leaving Lisbeth, Mr. Irwine had gone to Jonathan Burge, who had also a claim to be acquainted with what was likely to keep Adam away from business for some time; and before six o\u2019clock that evening there were few people in Broxton and Hayslope who had not heard the sad news. Mr. Irwine had not mentioned Arthur\u2019s name to Burge, and yet the story of his conduct towards Hetty, with all the dark shadows cast upon it by its terrible consequences, was presently as well known as that his grandfather was dead, and that he was come into the estate. For Martin Poyser felt no motive to keep silence towards the one or two neighbours who ventured to come and shake him sorrowfully by the hand on the first day of his trouble; and Carroll, who kept his ears open to all that passed at the rectory, had framed an inferential version of the story, and found early opportunities of communicating it.

I share your concern for Adam, though he is not the only one whose sufferings I care for in this affair. He intends to remain at Stoniton till after the trial: it will come on probably a week to-morrow. He has taken a room there, and I encouraged him to do so, because I think it better he should be away from his own home at present; and, poor fellow, he still believes Hetty is innocent\u2014he wants to summon up courage to see her if he can; he is unwilling to leave the spot where she is.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDo you think the creatur\u2019s guilty, then?\u201d said Bartle. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll hang her?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m afraid it will go hard with her. The evidence is very strong. And one bad symptom is that she denies everything\u2014denies that she has had a child in the face of the most positive evidence. I saw her myself, and she was obstinately silent to me; she shrank up like a frightened animal when she saw me. I was never so shocked in my life as at the change in her. But I trust that, in the worst case, we may obtain a pardon for the sake of the innocent who are involved.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d said Bartle, forgetting in his irritation to whom he was speaking. \u201cI beg your pardon, sir, I mean it\u2019s stuff and nonsense for the innocent to care about her being hanged. For my own part, I think the sooner such women are put out o\u2019 the world the better; and the men that help \u2019em to do mischief had better go along with \u2019em for that matter. What good will you do by keeping such vermin alive, eating the victual that \u2019ud feed rational beings? But if Adam\u2019s fool enough to care about it, I don\u2019t want him to suffer more than\u2019s needful.... Is he very much cut up, poor fellow?\u201d Bartle added, taking out his spectacles and putting them on, as if they would assist his imagination. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid the grief cuts very deep,\u201d said Mr. Irwine. \u201cHe looks terribly shattered, and a certain violence came over him now and then yesterday, which made me wish I could have remained near him. But I shall go to Stoniton again to-morrow, and I have confidence enough in the strength of Adam\u2019s principle to trust that he will be able to endure the worst without being driven to anything rash.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr. Irwine, who was involuntarily uttering his own thoughts rather than addressing Bartle Massey in the last sentence, had in his mind the possibility that the spirit of vengeance towards Arthur, which was the form Adam\u2019s anguish was continually taking, might make him seek an encounter that was likely to end more fatally than the one in the Grove. This possibility heightened the anxiety with which he looked forward to Arthur\u2019s arrival. But Bartle thought Mr. Irwine was referring to suicide, and his face wore a new alarm. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I have in my head, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cand I hope you\u2019ll approve of it. I\u2019m going to shut up my school\u2014if the scholars come, they must go back again, that\u2019s all\u2014and I shall go to Stoniton and look after Adam till this business is over. I\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m come to look on at the assizes; he can\u2019t object to that. What do you think about it, sir?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Irwine, rather hesitatingly, \u201cthere would be some real advantages in that... and I honour you for your friendship towards him, Bartle. But... you must be careful what you say to him, you know. I\u2019m afraid you have too little fellow-feeling in what you consider his weakness about Hetty.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTrust to me, sir\u2014trust to me. I know what you mean. I\u2019ve been a fool myself in my time, but that\u2019s between you and me. I shan\u2019t thrust myself on him only keep my eye on him, and see that he gets some good food, and put in a word here and there.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThen,\u201d said Mr. Irwine, reassured a little as to Bartle\u2019s discretion, \u201cI think you\u2019ll be doing a good deed; and it will be well for you to let Adam\u2019s mother and brother know that you\u2019re going.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, sir, yes,\u201d said Bartle, rising, and taking off his spectacles, \u201cI\u2019ll do that, I\u2019ll do that; though the mother\u2019s a whimpering thing\u2014I don\u2019t like to come within earshot of her; however, she\u2019s a straight-backed, clean woman, none of your slatterns. I wish you good-bye, sir, and thank you for the time you\u2019ve spared me. You\u2019re everybody\u2019s friend in this business\u2014everybody\u2019s friend. It\u2019s a heavy weight you\u2019ve got on your shoulders.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGood-bye, Bartle, till we meet at Stoniton, as I daresay we shall.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Bartle hurried away from the rectory, evading Carroll\u2019s conversational advances, and saying in an exasperated tone to Vixen, whose short legs pattered beside him on the gravel, \u201cNow, I shall be obliged to take you with me, you good-for-nothing woman. You\u2019d go fretting yourself to death if I left you\u2014you know you would, and perhaps get snapped up by some tramp. And you\u2019ll be running into bad company, I expect, putting your nose in every hole and corner where you\u2019ve no business! But if you do anything disgraceful, I\u2019ll disown you\u2014mind that, madam, mind that!\u201d"))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

Under Lady Cheverel\u2019s uncaressing authoritative goodwill, Tina had always retained a certain constraint and awe; and there was a sweetness before unknown in having a young and gentle woman, like an elder sister, bending over her caressingly, and speaking in low loving tones. "),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"Maynard was almost angry with himself for feeling happy while Tina\u2019s mind and body were still trembling on the verge of irrecoverable decline; but the new delight of acting as her guardian angel, of being with her every hour of the day, of devising everything for her comfort, of watching for a ray of returning interest in her eyes, was too absorbing to leave room for alarm or regret.

"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"Brightly the fire shone in the great parlour, and brightly in the little pink bedroom, which was to be Caterina\u2019s, because it looked away from the churchyard, and on to a farm homestead, with its little cluster of beehive ricks, and placid groups of cows, and cheerful matin sounds of healthy labour. Mrs. Heron, with the instinct of a delicate, impressible woman, had written to her husband to have this room prepared for Caterina. Contented speckled hens, industriously scratching for the rarely-found corn, may sometimes do more for a sick heart than a grove of nightingales; there is something irresistibly calming in the unsentimental cheeriness of top-knotted pullets, unpetted sheep-dogs, and patient cart-horses enjoying a drink of muddy water. "),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"In such a home as this parsonage, a nest of comfort, without any of the stateliness that would carry a suggestion of Cheverel Manor, Mr. Gilfil was not unreasonable in hoping that Caterina might gradually shake off the haunting vision of the past, and recover from the languor and feebleness which were the physical sign of that vision\u2019s blighting presence. The next thing to be done was to arrange an exchange of duties with Mr. Heron\u2019s curate, that Maynard might be constantly near Caterina, and watch over her progress. She seemed to like him to be with her, to look uneasily for his return; and though she seldom spoke to him, she was most contented when he sat by her, and held her tiny hand in his large protecting grasp. But Oswald, ",(0,r.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"alias")," Ozzy, the broad-chested boy, was perhaps her most beneficial companion. With something of his uncle\u2019s person, he had inherited also his uncle\u2019s early taste for a domestic menagerie, and was very imperative in demanding Tina\u2019s sympathy in the welfare of his guinea-pigs, squirrels, and dormice. With him she seemed now and then to have gleams of her childhood coming athwart the leaden clouds, and many hours of winter went by the more easily for being spent in Ozzy\u2019s nursery. "),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"Mrs. Heron was not musical, and had no instrument; but one of Mr. Gilfil\u2019s cares was to procure a harpsichord, and have it placed in the drawing-room, always open, in the hope that some day the spirit of music would be reawakened in Caterina, and she would be attracted towards the instrument. But the winter was almost gone by, and he had waited in vain. The utmost improvement in Tina had not gone beyond passiveness and acquiescence--a quiet grateful smile, compliance with Oswald\u2019s whims, and an increasing consciousness of what was being said and done around her. Sometimes she would take up a bit of woman\u2019s work, but she seemed too languid to persevere in it; her fingers soon dropped, and she relapsed into motionless reverie.

Maynard had been walking with her and Oswald round the garden to look at the snowdrops, and she was resting on the sofa after the walk.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  You would hardly have known it was Adam without being told. His face has got thinner this last week: he has the sunken eyes, the neglected beard of a man just risen from a sick-bed. His heavy black hair hangs over his forehead, and there is no active impulse in him which inclines him to push it off, that he may be more awake to what is around him. He has one arm over the back of the chair, and he seems to be looking down at his clasped hands. He is roused by a knock at the door.

I have done everything now, however\u2014everything that can be done to-night, at least.

Three or four days ago, before you were mentioned to her, when I asked her if there was any one of her family whom she would like to see\u2014to whom she could open her mind\u2014she said, with a violent shudder, \u2018Tell them not to come near me\u2014I won\u2019t see any of them.\u2019\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam\u2019s head was hanging down again, and he did not speak.

It is just possible, notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, that the interview might affect her favourably. But I grieve to say I have scarcely any hope of that. She didn\u2019t seem agitated when I mentioned your name; she only said \u2018No,\u2019 in the same cold, obstinate way as usual. And if the meeting had no good effect on her, it would be pure, useless suffering to you\u2014severe suffering, I fear.

He has a heart and a conscience: I can\u2019t be entirely deceived in his character. I am convinced\u2014I am sure he didn\u2019t fall under temptation without a struggle. He may be weak, but he is not callous, not coldly selfish. I am persuaded that this will be a shock of which he will feel the effects all his life. Why do you crave vengeance in this way?

I thought she loved me... and was good...\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam\u2019s voice had been gradually sinking into a hoarse undertone, as if he were only talking to himself; but now he said abruptly, looking at Mr. Irwine, \u201cBut she isn\u2019t as guilty as they say? You don\u2019t think she is, sir? She can\u2019t ha\u2019 done it.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat perhaps can never be known with certainty, Adam,\u201d Mr. Irwine answered gently. \u201cIn these cases we sometimes form our judgment on what seems to us strong evidence, and yet, for want of knowing some small fact, our judgment is wrong. But suppose the worst: you have no right to say that the guilt of her crime lies with him, and that he ought to bear the punishment. It is not for us men to apportion the shares of moral guilt and retribution. We find it impossible to avoid mistakes even in determining who has committed a single criminal act, and the problem how far a man is to be held responsible for the unforeseen consequences of his own deed is one that might well make us tremble to look into it. The evil consequences that may lie folded in a single act of selfish indulgence is a thought so awful that it ought surely to awaken some feeling less presumptuous than a rash desire to punish. You have a mind that can understand this fully, Adam, when you are calm. Don\u2019t suppose I can\u2019t enter into the anguish that drives you into this state of revengeful hatred. But think of this: if you were to obey your passion\u2014for it ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"is")," passion, and you deceive yourself in calling it justice\u2014it might be with you precisely as it has been with Arthur; nay, worse; your passion might lead you yourself into a horrible crime.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo\u2014not worse,\u201d said Adam, bitterly; \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s worse\u2014I\u2019d sooner do it\u2014I\u2019d sooner do a wickedness as I could suffer for by myself than ha\u2019 brought ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her")," to do wickedness and then stand by and see \u2019em punish her while they let me alone; and all for a bit o\u2019 pleasure, as, if he\u2019d had a man\u2019s heart in him, he\u2019d ha\u2019 cut his hand off sooner than he\u2019d ha\u2019 taken it. What if he didn\u2019t foresee what\u2019s happened? He foresaw enough; he\u2019d no right to expect anything but harm and shame to her. And then he wanted to smooth it off wi\u2019 lies. No\u2014there\u2019s plenty o\u2019 things folks are hanged for not half so hateful as that. Let a man do what he will, if he knows he\u2019s to bear the punishment himself, he isn\u2019t half so bad as a mean selfish coward as makes things easy t\u2019 himself and knows all the while the punishment \u2019ll fall on somebody else.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere again you partly deceive yourself, Adam. There is no sort of wrong deed of which a man can bear the punishment alone; you can\u2019t isolate yourself and say that the evil which is in you shall not spread. Men\u2019s lives are as thoroughly blended with each other as the air they breathe: evil spreads as necessarily as disease. I know, I feel the terrible extent of suffering this sin of Arthur\u2019s has caused to others; but so does every sin cause suffering to others besides those who commit it. An act of vengeance on your part against Arthur would simply be another evil added to those we are suffering under: you could not bear the punishment alone; you would entail the worst sorrows on every one who loves you. You would have committed an act of blind fury that would leave all the present evils just as they were and add worse evils to them. You may tell me that you meditate no fatal act of vengeance, but the feeling in your mind is what gives birth to such actions, and as long as you indulge it, as long as you do not see that to fix your mind on Arthur\u2019s punishment is revenge, and not justice, you are in danger of being led on to the commission of some great wrong. Remember what you told me about your feelings after you had given that blow to Arthur in the Grove.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Adam was silent: the last words had called up a vivid image of the past, and Mr. Irwine left him to his thoughts, while he spoke to Bartle Massey about old Mr. Donnithorne\u2019s funeral and other matters of an indifferent kind. But at length Adam turned round and said, in a more subdued tone, \u201cI\u2019ve not asked about \u2019em at th\u2019 Hall Farm, sir.

But perhaps the Poysers would ha\u2019 been sorely against it, since they won\u2019t come nigh her themselves. But I think she would, for the Methodists are great folks for going into the prisons; and Seth said he thought she would. She\u2019d a very tender way with her, Dinah had; I wonder if she could ha\u2019 done any good. You never saw her, sir, did you?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, I did. I had a conversation with her\u2014she pleased me a good deal. And now you mention it, I wish she would come, for it is possible that a gentle mild woman like her might move Hetty to open her heart.

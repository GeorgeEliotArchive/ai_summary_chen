"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"On the day when Gwendolen Harleth was married and became Mrs. Grandcourt, the morning was clear and bright, and while the sun was low a slight frost crisped the leaves. The bridal party was worth seeing, and half Pennicote turned out to see it, lining the pathway up to the church. An old friend of the rector\u2019s performed the marriage ceremony, the rector himself acting as father, to the great advantage of the procession. Only two faces, it was remarked, showed signs of sadness\u2014Mrs. Davilow\u2019s and Anna\u2019s. The mother\u2019s delicate eyelids were pink, as if she had been crying half the night; and no one was surprised that, splendid as the match was, she should feel the parting from a daughter who was the flower of her children and of her own life. It was less understood why Anna should be troubled when she was being so well set off by the bridesmaid\u2019s dress. Every one else seemed to reflect the brilliancy of the occasion\u2014the bride most of all. Of her it was agreed that as to figure and carriage she was worthy to be a \u201clady o\u2019 title\u201d: as to face, perhaps it might be thought that a title required something more rosy; but the bridegroom himself not being fresh-colored\u2014being indeed, as the miller\u2019s wife observed, very much of her own husband\u2019s complexion\u2014the match was the more complete. Anyhow he must be very fond of her; and it was to be hoped that he would never cast it up to her that she had been going out to service as a governess, and her mother to live at Sawyer\u2019s Cottage\u2014vicissitudes which had been much spoken of in the village. The miller\u2019s daughter of fourteen could not believe that high gentry behaved badly to their wives, but her mother instructed her\u2014\u201cOh, child, men\u2019s men: gentle or simple, they\u2019re much of a muchness.

It was not pain, however, that she was feeling: she had wrought herself up to much the same condition as that in which she stood at the gambling-table when Deronda was looking at her, and she began to lose. There was an enjoyment in it: whatever uneasiness a growing conscience had created was disregarded as an ailment might have been, amidst the gratification of that ambitious vanity and desire for luxury within her which it would take a great deal of slow poisoning to kill. This morning she could not have said truly that she repented her acceptance of Grandcourt, or that any fears in hazy perspective could hinder the glowing effect of the immediate scene in which she was the central object. That she was doing something wrong\u2014that a punishment might be hanging over her\u2014that the woman to whom she had given a promise and broken it, was thinking of her in bitterness and misery with a just reproach\u2014that Deronda with his way of looking into things very likely despised her for marrying Grandcourt, as he had despised her for gambling\u2014above all, that the cord which united her with this lover and which she had heretofore held by the hand, was now being flung over her neck,\u2014all this yeasty mingling of dimly understood facts with vague but deep impressions, and with images half real, half fantastic, had been disturbing her during the weeks of her engagement. Was that agitating experience nullified this morning? No: it was surmounted and thrust down with a sort of exulting defiance as she felt herself standing at the game of life with many eyes upon her, daring everything to win much\u2014or if to lose, still with ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"\xe9clat")," and a sense of importance. But this morning a losing destiny for herself did not press upon her as a fear: she thought that she was entering on a fuller power of managing circumstances\u2014with all the official strength of marriage, which some women made so poor a use of. That intoxication of youthful egoism out of which she had been shaken by trouble, humiliation, and a new sense of culpability, had returned upon her under a newly-fed strength of the old fumes. She did not in the least present the ideal of the tearful, tremulous bride. Poor Gwendolen, whom some had judged much too forward and instructed in the world\u2019s ways!\u2014with her erect head and elastic footstep she was walking among illusions; and yet, too, there was an under-consciousness of her that she was a little intoxicated.

She was really getting somewhat febrile in her excitement; and now in this drive through the park her usual susceptibility to changes of light and scenery helped to make her heart palpitate newly. Was it at the novelty simply, or the almost incredible fulfilment about to be given to her girlish dreams of being \u201csomebody\u201d\u2014walking through her own furlong of corridor and under her own ceilings of an out-of-sight loftiness, where her own painted Spring was shedding painted flowers, and her own fore-shortened Zephyrs were blowing their trumpets over her; while her own servants, lackeys in clothing but men in bulk and shape, were as nought in her presence, and revered the propriety of her insolence to them:\u2014being in short the heroine of an admired play without the pains of art? Was it alone the closeness of this fulfilment which made her heart flutter? or was it some dim forecast, the insistent penetration of suppressed experience, mixing the expectation of a triumph with the dread of a crisis?

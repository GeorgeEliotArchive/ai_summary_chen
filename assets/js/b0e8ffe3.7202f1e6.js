At half-past eight o\u2019clock she went up to Tina\u2019s room, bent on benevolent dictation as to doses and diet and lying in bed. But on opening the door she found the bed smooth and empty. Evidently it had not been slept in. What could this mean? Had she sat up all night, and was she gone out to walk? The poor thing\u2019s head might be touched by what had happened yesterday; it was such a shock--finding Captain Wybrow in that way; she was perhaps gone out of her mind. Mrs. Sharp looked anxiously in the place where Tina kept her hat and cloak; they were not there, so that she had had at least the presence of mind to put them on.

When the Rookery had been searched in vain, he walked fast to the border of the little stream that bounded one side of the grounds.

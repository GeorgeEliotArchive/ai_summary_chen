The bright sun on the chestnut boughs and the roofs opposite his window had made him impatiently declare that he would be caged up no longer; he thought everywhere would be more cheery under this sunshine than his bedroom; for he knew nothing of the bareness below, which made the flood of sunshine importunate, as if it had an unfeeling pleasure in showing the empty places, and the marks where well-known objects once had been. The impression on his mind that it was but yesterday when he received the letter from Mr Gore was so continually implied in his talk, and the attempts to convey to him the idea that many weeks had passed and much had happened since then had been so soon swept away by recurrent forgetfulness, that even Mr Turnbull had begun to despair of preparing him to meet the facts by previous knowledge. The full sense of the present could only be imparted gradually by new experience,\u2014not by mere words, which must remain weaker than the impressions left by the ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"old")," experience. This resolution to come downstairs was heard with trembling by the wife and children. Mrs Tulliver said Tom must not go to St Ogg\u2019s at the usual hour, he must wait and see his father downstairs; and Tom complied, though with an intense inward shrinking from the painful scene. The hearts of all three had been more deeply dejected than ever during the last few days. For Guest &Co. had not bought the mill; both mill and land had been knocked down to Wakem, who had been over the premises, and had laid before Mr Deane and Mr Glegg, in Mrs Tulliver\u2019s presence, his willingness to employ Mr Tulliver, in case of his recovery, as a manager of the business. This proposition had occasioned much family debating. Uncles and aunts were almost unanimously of opinion that such an offer ought not to be rejected when there was nothing in the way but a feeling in Mr Tulliver\u2019s mind, which, as neither aunts nor uncles shared it, was regarded as entirely unreasonable and childish,\u2014indeed, as a transferring toward Wakem of that indignation and hatred which Mr Tulliver ought properly to have directed against himself for his general quarrelsomeness, and his special exhibition of it in going to law. Here was an opportunity for Mr Tulliver to provide for his wife and daughter without any assistance from his wife\u2019s relations, and without that too evident descent into pauperism which makes it annoying to respectable people to meet the degraded member of the family by the wayside. Mr Tulliver, Mrs Glegg considered, must be made to feel, when he came to his right mind, that he could never humble himself enough; for ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"that")," had come which she had always foreseen would come of his insolence in time past \u201cto them as were the best friends he\u2019d got to look to.\u201d Mr Glegg and Mr Deane were less stern in their views, but they both of them thought Tulliver had done enough harm by his hot-tempered crotchets and ought to put them out of the question when a livelihood was offered him; Wakem showed a right feeling about the matter,\u2014",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"he")," had no grudge against Tulliver. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Tom had protested against entertaining the proposition. He shouldn\u2019t like his father to be under Wakem; he thought it would look mean-spirited; but his mother\u2019s main distress was the utter impossibility of ever \u201cturning Mr Tulliver round about Wakem,\u201d or getting him to hear reason; no, they would all have to go and live in a pigsty on purpose to spite Wakem, who spoke \u201cso as nobody could be fairer.\u201d Indeed, Mrs Tulliver\u2019s mind was reduced to such confusion by living in this strange medium of unaccountable sorrow, against which she continually appealed by asking, \u201cOh dear, what ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"have")," I done to deserve worse than other women?\u201d that Maggie began to suspect her poor mother\u2019s wits were quite going. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTom,\u201d she said, when they were out of their father\u2019s room together, \u201cwe ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"must")," try to make father understand a little of what has happened before he goes downstairs. But we must get my mother away. She will say something that will do harm. Ask Kezia to fetch her down, and keep her engaged with something in the kitchen.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Kezia was equal to the task. Having declared her intention of staying till the master could get about again, \u201cwage or no wage,\u201d she had found a certain recompense in keeping a strong hand over her mistress, scolding her for \u201cmoithering\u201d herself, and going about all day without changing her cap, and looking as if she was \u201cmushed.\u201d Altogether, this time of trouble was rather a Saturnalian time to Kezia; she could scold her betters with unreproved freedom. On this particular occasion there were drying clothes to be fetched in; she wished to know if one pair of hands could do everything in-doors and out, and observed that ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"she")," should have thought it would be good for Mrs Tulliver to put on her bonnet, and get a breath of fresh air by doing that needful piece of work. Poor Mrs Tulliver went submissively downstairs; to be ordered about by a servant was the last remnant of her household dignities,\u2014she would soon have no servant to scold her. Mr Tulliver was resting in his chair a little after the fatigue of dressing, and Maggie and Tom were seated near him, when Luke entered to ask if he should help master downstairs. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, ay, Luke; stop a bit, sit down,\u201d said Mr Tulliver pointing his stick toward a chair, and looking at him with that pursuant gaze which convalescent persons often have for those who have tended them, reminding one of an infant gazing about after its nurse. For Luke had been a constant night-watcher by his master\u2019s bed. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHow\u2019s the water now, eh, Luke?\u201d said Mr Tulliver. \u201cDix hasn\u2019t been choking you up again, eh?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, sir, it\u2019s all right.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, I thought not; he won\u2019t be in a hurry at that again, now Riley\u2019s been to settle him. That was what I said to Riley yesterday\u2014I said\u2014\u2014\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Tulliver leaned forward, resting his elbows on the armchair, and looking on the ground as if in search of something, striving after vanishing images like a man struggling against a doze. Maggie looked at Tom in mute distress, their father\u2019s mind was so far off the present, which would by-and-by thrust itself on his wandering consciousness! Tom was almost ready to rush away, with that impatience of painful emotion which makes one of the differences between youth and maiden, man and woman. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cFather,\u201d said Maggie, laying her hand on his, \u201cdon\u2019t you remember that Mr Riley is dead?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDead?\u201d said Mr Tulliver, sharply, looking in her face with a strange, examining glance. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, he died of apoplexy nearly a year ago. I remember hearing you say you had to pay money for him; and he left his daughters badly off; one of them is under-teacher at Miss Firniss\u2019s, where I\u2019ve been to school, you know.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh?\u201d said her father, doubtfully, still looking in her face. But as soon as Tom began to speak he turned to look at ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"him")," with the same inquiring glances, as if he were rather surprised at the presence of these two young people. Whenever his mind was wandering in the far past, he fell into this oblivion of their actual faces; they were not those of the lad and the little wench who belonged to that past. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s a long while since you had the dispute with Dix, father,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI remember your talking about it three years ago, before I went to school at Mr Stelling\u2019s. I\u2019ve been at school there three years; don\u2019t you remember?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Tulliver threw himself backward again, losing the childlike outward glance under a rush of new ideas, which diverted him from external impressions. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, ay,\u201d he said, after a minute or two, \u201cI\u2019ve paid a deal o\u2019 money\u2014I was determined my son should have a good eddication; I\u2019d none myself, and I\u2019ve felt the miss of it. And he\u2019ll want no other fortin, that\u2019s what I say\u2014if Wakem was to get the better of me again\u2014\u2014\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  The thought of Wakem roused new vibrations, and after a moment\u2019s pause he began to look at the coat he had on, and to feel in his side-pocket. Then he turned to Tom, and said in his old sharp way, \u201cWhere have they put Gore\u2019s letter?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  It was close at hand in a drawer, for he had often asked for it before. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou know what there is in the letter, father?\u201d said Tom, as he gave it to him. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTo be sure I do,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, rather angrily. \u201cWhat o\u2019 that? If Furley can\u2019t take to the property, somebody else can; there\u2019s plenty o\u2019 people in the world besides Furley. But it\u2019s hindering\u2014my not being well\u2014go and tell \u2019em to get the horse in the gig, Luke; I can get down to St Ogg\u2019s well enough\u2014Gore\u2019s expecting me.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, dear father!\u201d Maggie burst out entreatingly; \u201cit\u2019s a very long while since all that; you\u2019ve been ill a great many weeks,\u2014more than two months; everything is changed.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Tulliver looked at them all three alternately with a startled gaze; the idea that much had happened of which he knew nothing had often transiently arrested him before, but it came upon him now with entire novelty. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, father,\u201d said Tom, in answer to the gaze. \u201cYou needn\u2019t trouble your mind about business until you are quite well; everything is settled about that for the present,\u2014about the mill and the land and the debts.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat\u2019s settled, then?\u201d said his father, angrily. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDon\u2019t you take on too much bout it, sir,\u201d said Luke. \u201cYou\u2019d ha\u2019 paid iverybody if you could,\u2014that\u2019s what I said to Master Tom,\u2014I said you\u2019d ha\u2019 paid iverybody if you could.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Good Luke felt, after the manner of contented hard-working men whose lives have been spent in servitude, that sense of natural fitness in rank which made his master\u2019s downfall a tragedy to him. He was urged, in his slow way, to say something that would express his share in the family sorrow; and these words, which he had used over and over again to Tom when he wanted to decline the full payment of his fifty pounds out of the children\u2019s money, were the most ready to his tongue. They were just the words to lay the most painful hold on his master\u2019s bewildered mind. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cPaid everybody?\u201d he said, with vehement agitation, his face flushing, and his eye lighting up. \u201cWhy\u2014what\u2014have they made me a ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"bankrupt?"),"\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, father, dear father!\u201d said Maggie, who thought that terrible word really represented the fact; \u201cbear it well, because we love you; your children will always love you. Tom will pay them all; he says he will, when he\u2019s a man.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  She felt her father beginning to tremble; his voice trembled too, as he said, after a few moments: "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, my little wench, but I shall never live twice o\u2019er.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut perhaps you will live to see me pay everybody, father,\u201d said Tom, speaking with a great effort.

I\u2019ve given you a good eddication,\u2014that\u2019ll start you.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Something in his throat half choked the last words; the flush, which had alarmed his children because it had so often preceded a recurrence of paralysis, had subsided, and his face looked pale and tremulous. Tom said nothing; he was still struggling against his inclination to rush away. His father remained quiet a minute or two, but his mind did not seem to be wandering again. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHave they sold me up, then?\u201d he said more calmly, as if he were possessed simply by the desire to know what had happened. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cEverything is sold, father; but we don\u2019t know all about the mill and the land yet,\u201d said Tom, anxious to ward off any question leading to the fact that Wakem was the purchaser. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou must not be surprised to see the room look very bare downstairs, father,\u201d said Maggie; \u201cbut there\u2019s your chair and the bureau; ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"they\u2019re")," not gone.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet us go; help me down, Luke,\u2014I\u2019ll go and see everything,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, leaning on his stick, and stretching out his other hand toward Luke.

She turned her father\u2019s chair, and pushed aside the table to make an easy way for him, and then stood with a beating heart to see him enter and look round for the first time. Tom advanced before him, carrying the leg-rest, and stood beside Maggie on the hearth. Of those two young hearts Tom\u2019s suffered the most unmixed pain, for Maggie, with all her keen susceptibility, yet felt as if the sorrow made larger room for her love to flow in, and gave breathing-space to her passionate nature. No true boy feels that; he would rather go and slay the Nemean lion, or perform any round of heroic labours, than endure perpetual appeals to his pity, for evils over which he can make no conquest. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Tulliver paused just inside the door, resting on Luke, and looking round him at all the bare places, which for him were filled with the shadows of departed objects,\u2014the daily companions of his life. His faculties seemed to be renewing their strength from getting a footing on this demonstration of the senses. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh!\u201d he said slowly, moving toward his chair, \u201cthey\u2019ve sold me up\u2014they\u2019ve sold me up.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"  Then seating himself, and laying down his stick, while Luke left the room, he looked round again.

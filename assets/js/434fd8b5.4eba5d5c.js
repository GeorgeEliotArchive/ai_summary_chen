Can her mind be really made up against him?\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Gwendolen would have been rather angry if that thought had been uttered; perhaps all the more because through the last twenty hours, with a brief interruption of sleep, she had been so occupied with perpetually alternating images and arguments for and against the possibility of her marrying Grandcourt, that the conclusion which she had determined on beforehand ceased to have any hold on her consciousness: the alternate dip of counterbalancing thoughts begotten of counterbalancing desires had brought her into a state in which no conclusion could look fixed to her. She would have expressed her resolve as before; but it was a form out of which the blood had been sucked\u2014no more a part of quivering life than the \u201cGod\u2019s will be done\u201d of one who is eagerly watching chances. She did not mean to accept Grandcourt; from the first moment of receiving his letter she had meant to refuse him; still, that could not but prompt her to look the unwelcome reasons full in the face until she had a little less awe of them, could not hinder her imagination from filling out her knowledge in various ways, some of which seemed to change the aspect of what she knew. By dint of looking at a dubious object with a constructive imagination, one can give it twenty different shapes. Her indistinct grounds of hesitation before the interview at the Whispering Stones, at present counted for nothing; they were all merged in the final repulsion. If it had not been for that day in Cardell Chase, she said to herself now, there would have been no obstacle to her marrying Grandcourt. On that day and after it, she had not reasoned and balanced; she had acted with a force of impulse against which all questioning was no more than a voice against a torrent. The impulse had come\u2014not only from her maidenly pride and jealousy, not only from the shock of another woman\u2019s calamity thrust close on her vision, but\u2014from her dread of wrong-doing, which was vague, it was true, and aloof from the daily details of her life, but not the less strong. Whatever was accepted as consistent with being a lady she had no scruple about; but from the dim region of what was called disgraceful, wrong, guilty, she shrunk with mingled pride and terror; and even apart from shame, her feeling would have made her place any deliberate injury of another in the region of guilt. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"But now\u2014did she know exactly what was the state of the case with regard to Mrs. Glasher and her children? She had given a sort of promise\u2014had said, \u201cI will not interfere with your wishes.\u201d But would another woman who married Grandcourt be in fact the decisive obstacle to her wishes, or be doing her and her boy any real injury? Might it not be just as well, nay better, that Grandcourt should marry? For what could not a woman do when she was married, if she knew how to assert herself? Here all was constructive imagination. Gwendolen had about as accurate a conception of marriage\u2014that is to say, of the mutual influences, demands, duties of man and woman in the state of matrimony\u2014as she had of magnetic currents and the law of storms. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cMamma managed badly,\u201d was her way of summing up what she had seen of her mother\u2019s experience: she herself would manage quite differently.

"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cI wonder what mamma and my uncle would say if they knew about Mrs. Glasher!\u201d thought Gwendolen in her inward debating; not that she could imagine herself telling them, even if she had not felt bound to silence. \u201cI wonder what anybody would say; or what they would say to Mr. Grandcourt\u2019s marrying some one else and having other children!\u201d To consider what \u201canybody\u201d would say, was to be released from the difficulty of judging where everything was obscure to her when feeling had ceased to be decisive. She had only to collect her memories, which proved to her that \u201canybody\u201d regarded the illegitimate children as more rightfully to be looked shy on and deprived of social advantages than illegitimate fathers. The verdict of \u201canybody\u201d seemed to be that she had no reason to concern herself greatly on behalf of Mrs. Glasher and her children. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"But there was another way in which they had caused her concern. What others might think could not do away with a feeling which in the first instance would hardly be too strongly described as indignation and loathing that she should have been expected to unite herself with an outworn life, full of backward secrets which must have been more keenly felt than any association with ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her"),". True, the question of love on her own part had occupied her scarcely at all in relation to Grandcourt. The desirability of marriage for her had always seemed due to other feeling than love; and to be enamored was the part of the man, on whom the advances depended. Gwendolen had found no objection to Grandcourt\u2019s way of being enamored before she had had that glimpse of his past, which she resented as if it had been a deliberate offense against her. His advances to ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"her")," were deliberate, and she felt a retrospective disgust for them. Perhaps other men\u2019s lives were of the same kind\u2014full of secrets which made the ignorant suppositions of the women they wanted to marry a farce at which they were laughing in their sleeves. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"These feelings of disgust and indignation had sunk deep; and though other troublous experience in the last weeks had dulled them from passion into remembrance, it was chiefly their reverberating activity which kept her firm to the understanding with herself, that she was not going to accept Grandcourt. She had never meant to form a new determination; she had only been considering what might be thought or said. If anything could have induced her to change, it would have been the prospect of making all things easy for \u201cpoor mamma:\u201d that, she admitted, was a temptation. But no! she was going to refuse him. Meanwhile, the thought that he was coming to be refused was inspiriting: she had the white reins in her hands again; there was a new current in her frame, reviving her from the beaten-down consciousness in which she had been left by the interview with Klesmer. She was not now going to crave an opinion of her capabilities; she was going to exercise her power. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Was this what made her heart palpitate annoyingly when she heard the horse\u2019s footsteps on the gravel?\u2014when Miss Merry, who opened the door to Grandcourt, came to tell her that he was in the drawing-room? The hours of preparation and the triumph of the situation were apparently of no use: she might as well have seen Grandcourt coming suddenly on her in the midst of her despondency. While walking into the drawing-room, she had to concentrate all her energy in that self-control, which made her appear gravely gracious\u2014as she gave her hand to him, and answered his hope that she was quite well in a voice as low and languid as his own. A moment afterward, when they were both of them seated on two of the wreath-painted chairs\u2014Gwendolen upright with downcast eyelids, Grandcourt about two yards distant, leaning one arm over the back of his chair and looking at her, while he held his hat in his left hand\u2014any one seeing them as a picture would have concluded that they were in some stage of love-making suspense. And certainly the love-making had begun: she already felt herself being wooed by this silent man seated at an agreeable distance, with the subtlest atmosphere of attar of roses and an attention bent wholly on her.

She spoke with dignity and looked straight at Grandcourt, whose long, narrow, impenetrable eyes met hers, and mysteriously arrested them: mysteriously; for the subtly-varied drama between man and woman is often such as can hardly be rendered in words put together like dominoes, according to obvious fixed marks. The word of all work, Love, will no more express the myriad modes of mutual attraction, than the word Thought can inform you what is passing through your neighbor\u2019s mind.

She had a momentary phantasmal love for this man who chose his words so well, and who was a mere incarnation of delicate homage. Repugnance, dread, scruples\u2014these were dim as remembered pains, while she was already tasting relief under the immediate pain of hopelessness.

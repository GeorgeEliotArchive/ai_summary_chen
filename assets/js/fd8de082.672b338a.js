Across this brook a plank is thrown, and over this plank Adam Bede is passing with his undoubting step, followed close by Gyp with the basket; evidently making his way to the thatched house, with a stack of timber by the side of it, about twenty yards up the opposite slope. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The door of the house is open, and an elderly woman is looking out; but she is not placidly contemplating the evening sunshine; she has been watching with dim eyes the gradually enlarging speck which for the last few minutes she has been quite sure is her darling son Adam. Lisbeth Bede loves her son with the love of a woman to whom her first-born has come late in life. She is an anxious, spare, yet vigorous old woman, clean as a snowdrop. Her grey hair is turned neatly back under a pure linen cap with a black band round it; her broad chest is covered with a buff neckerchief, and below this you see a sort of short bedgown made of blue-checkered linen, tied round the waist and descending to the hips, from whence there is a considerable length of linsey-woolsey petticoat. For Lisbeth is tall, and in other points too there is a strong likeness between her and her son Adam. Her dark eyes are somewhat dim now\u2014perhaps from too much crying\u2014but her broadly marked eyebrows are still black, her teeth are sound, and as she stands knitting rapidly and unconsciously with her work-hardened hands, she has as firmly upright an attitude as when she is carrying a pail of water on her head from the spring. There is the same type of frame and the same keen activity of temperament in mother and son, but it was not from her that Adam got his well-filled brow and his expression of large-hearted intelligence. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Family likeness has often a deep sadness in it. Nature, that great tragic dramatist, knits us together by bone and muscle, and divides us by the subtler web of our brains; blends yearning and repulsion; and ties us by our heart-strings to the beings that jar us at every movement. We hear a voice with the very cadence of our own uttering the thoughts we despise; we see eyes\u2014ah, so like our mother\u2019s!\u2014averted from us in cold alienation; and our last darling child startles us with the air and gestures of the sister we parted from in bitterness long years ago. The father to whom we owe our best heritage\u2014the mechanical instinct, the keen sensibility to harmony, the unconscious skill of the modelling hand\u2014galls us and puts us to shame by his daily errors; the long-lost mother, whose face we begin to see in the glass as our own wrinkles come, once fretted our young souls with her anxious humours and irrational persistence. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It is such a fond anxious mother\u2019s voice that you hear, as Lisbeth says, \u201cWell, my lad, it\u2019s gone seven by th\u2019 clock. Thee\u2019t allays stay till the last child\u2019s born. Thee wants thy supper, I\u2019ll warrand. Where\u2019s Seth?

But where\u2019s father?\u201d said Adam quickly, as he entered the house and glanced into the room on the left hand, which was used as a workshop. \u201cHasn\u2019t he done the coffin for Tholer? There\u2019s the stuff standing just as I left it this morning.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDone the coffin?\u201d said Lisbeth, following him, and knitting uninterruptedly, though she looked at her son very anxiously. \u201cEh, my lad, he went aff to Treddles\u2019on this forenoon, an\u2019s niver come back. I doubt he\u2019s got to th\u2019 \u2018Waggin Overthrow\u2019 again.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  A deep flush of anger passed rapidly over Adam\u2019s face. He said nothing, but threw off his jacket and began to roll up his shirt-sleeves again. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat art goin\u2019 to do, Adam?\u201d said the mother, with a tone and look of alarm. \u201cThee wouldstna go to work again, wi\u2019out ha\u2019in thy bit o\u2019 supper?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam, too angry to speak, walked into the workshop.

But one of the lessons a woman most rarely learns is never to talk to an angry or a drunken man. Lisbeth sat down on the chopping bench and began to cry, and by the time she had cried enough to make her voice very piteous, she burst out into words. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, my lad, my lad, thee wouldstna go away an\u2019 break thy mother\u2019s heart, an\u2019 leave thy feyther to ruin.

Adam broke in impatiently. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow, Mother, don\u2019t cry and talk so. Haven\u2019t I got enough to vex me without that?

I know there\u2019s a duty to be done by my father, but it isn\u2019t my duty to encourage him in running headlong to ruin. And what has Seth got to do with it? The lad does no harm as I know of. But leave me alone, Mother, and let me get on with the work.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Lisbeth dared not say any more; but she got up and called Gyp, thinking to console herself somewhat for Adam\u2019s refusal of the supper she had spread out in the loving expectation of looking at him while he ate it, by feeding Adam\u2019s dog with extra liberality. But Gyp was watching his master with wrinkled brow and ears erect, puzzled at this unusual course of things; and though he glanced at Lisbeth when she called him, and moved his fore-paws uneasily, well knowing that she was inviting him to supper, he was in a divided state of mind, and remained seated on his haunches, again fixing his eyes anxiously on his master. Adam noticed Gyp\u2019s mental conflict, and though his anger had made him less tender than usual to his mother, it did not prevent him from caring as much as usual for his dog. We are apt to be kinder to the brutes that love us than to the women that love us. Is it because the brutes are dumb? "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGo, Gyp; go, lad!\u201d Adam said, in a tone of encouraging command; and Gyp, apparently satisfied that duty and pleasure were one, followed Lisbeth into the house-place. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But no sooner had he licked up his supper than he went back to his master, while Lisbeth sat down alone to cry over her knitting. Women who are never bitter and resentful are often the most querulous; and if Solomon was as wise as he is reputed to be, I feel sure that when he compared a contentious woman to a continual dropping on a very rainy day, he had not a vixen in his eye\u2014a fury with long nails, acrid and selfish. Depend upon it, he meant a good creature, who had no joy but in the happiness of the loved ones whom she contributed to make uncomfortable, putting by all the tid-bits for them and spending nothing on herself. Such a woman as Lisbeth, for example\u2014at once patient and complaining, self-renouncing and exacting, brooding the livelong day over what happened yesterday and what is likely to happen to-morrow, and crying very readily both at the good and the evil. But a certain awe mingled itself with her idolatrous love of Adam, and when he said, \u201cLeave me alone,\u201d she was always silenced. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  So the hours passed, to the loud ticking of the old day-clock and the sound of Adam\u2019s tools. At last he called for a light and a draught of water (beer was a thing only to be drunk on holidays), and Lisbeth ventured to say as she took it in, \u201cThy supper stan\u2019s ready for thee, when thee lik\u2019st.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDonna thee sit up, mother,\u201d said Adam, in a gentle tone. He had worked off his anger now, and whenever he wished to be especially kind to his mother, he fell into his strongest native accent and dialect, with which at other times his speech was less deeply tinged. \u201cI\u2019ll see to Father when he comes home; maybe he wonna come at all to-night.

He had heard the sound of the tools as he was approaching.

Seth had never in his life spoken a harsh word to his mother, and timid people always wreak their peevishness on the gentle. But Seth, with an anxious look, had passed into the workshop and said, \u201cAddy, how\u2019s this? What!

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  So the mother and son knelt down together, and Seth prayed for the poor wandering father and for those who were sorrowing for him at home. And when he came to the petition that Adam might never be called to set up his tent in a far country, but that his mother might be cheered and comforted by his presence all the days of her pilgrimage, Lisbeth\u2019s ready tears flowed again, and she wept aloud. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  When they rose from their knees, Seth went to Adam again and said, \u201cWilt only lie down for an hour or two, and let me go on the while?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, Seth, no. Make Mother go to bed, and go thyself.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Meantime Lisbeth had dried her eyes, and now followed Seth, holding something in her hands. It was the brown-and-yellow platter containing the baked potatoes with the gravy in them and bits of meat which she had cut and mixed among them. Those were dear times, when wheaten bread and fresh meat were delicacies to working people. She set the dish down rather timidly on the bench by Adam\u2019s side and said, \u201cThee canst pick a bit while thee\u2019t workin\u2019. I\u2019ll bring thee another drop o\u2019 water.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAye, Mother, do,\u201d said Adam, kindly; \u201cI\u2019m getting very thirsty.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  In half an hour all was quiet; no sound was to be heard in the house but the loud ticking of the old day-clock and the ringing of Adam\u2019s tools. The night was very still: when Adam opened the door to look out at twelve o\u2019clock, the only motion seemed to be in the glowing, twinkling stars; every blade of grass was asleep. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Bodily haste and exertion usually leave our thoughts very much at the mercy of our feelings and imagination; and it was so to-night with Adam. While his muscles were working lustily, his mind seemed as passive as a spectator at a diorama: scenes of the sad past, and probably sad future, floating before him and giving place one to the other in swift succession. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He saw how it would be to-morrow morning, when he had carried the coffin to Broxton and was at home again, having his breakfast: his father perhaps would come in ashamed to meet his son\u2019s glance\u2014would sit down, looking older and more tottering than he had done the morning before, and hang down his head, examining the floor-quarries; while Lisbeth would ask him how he supposed the coffin had been got ready, that he had slinked off and left undone\u2014for Lisbeth was always the first to utter the word of reproach, although she cried at Adam\u2019s severity towards his father. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSo it will go on, worsening and worsening,\u201d thought Adam; \u201cthere\u2019s no slipping uphill again, and no standing still when once you \u2019ve begun to slip down.\u201d And then the day came back to him when he was a little fellow and used to run by his father\u2019s side, proud to be taken out to work, and prouder still to hear his father boasting to his fellow-workmen how \u201cthe little chap had an uncommon notion o\u2019 carpentering.\u201d What a fine active fellow his father was then! When people asked Adam whose little lad he was, he had a sense of distinction as he answered, \u201cI\u2019m Thias Bede\u2019s lad.\u201d He was quite sure everybody knew Thias Bede\u2014didn\u2019t he make the wonderful pigeon-house at Broxton parsonage? Those were happy days, especially when Seth, who was three years the younger, began to go out working too, and Adam began to be a teacher as well as a learner. But then came the days of sadness, when Adam was someway on in his teens, and Thias began to loiter at the public-houses, and Lisbeth began to cry at home, and to pour forth her plaints in the hearing of her sons. Adam remembered well the night of shame and anguish when he first saw his father quite wild and foolish, shouting a song out fitfully among his drunken companions at the \u201cWaggon Overthrown.\u201d He had run away once when he was only eighteen, making his escape in the morning twilight with a little blue bundle over his shoulder, and his \u201cmensuration book\u201d in his pocket, and saying to himself very decidedly that he could bear the vexations of home no longer\u2014he would go and seek his fortune, setting up his stick at the crossways and bending his steps the way it fell. But by the time he got to Stoniton, the thought of his mother and Seth, left behind to endure everything without him, became too importunate, and his resolution failed him. He came back the next day, but the misery and terror his mother had gone through in those two days had haunted her ever since. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo!\u201d Adam said to himself to-night, \u201cthat must never happen again. It \u2019ud make a poor balance when my doings are cast up at the last, if my poor old mother stood o\u2019 the wrong side. My back\u2019s broad enough and strong enough; I should be no better than a coward to go away and leave the troubles to be borne by them as aren\u2019t half so able. \u2018They that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of those that are weak, and not to please themselves.\u2019 There\u2019s a text wants no candle to show\u2019t; it shines by its own light. It\u2019s plain enough you get into the wrong road i\u2019 this life if you run after this and that only for the sake o\u2019 making things easy and pleasant to yourself. A pig may poke his nose into the trough and think o\u2019 nothing outside it; but if you\u2019ve got a man\u2019s heart and soul in you, you can\u2019t be easy a-making your own bed an\u2019 leaving the rest to lie on the stones. Nay, nay, I\u2019ll never slip my neck out o\u2019 the yoke, and leave the load to be drawn by the weak uns. Father\u2019s a sore cross to me, an\u2019s likely to be for many a long year to come. What then? I\u2019ve got th\u2019 health, and the limbs, and the sperrit to bear it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  At this moment a smart rap, as if with a willow wand, was given at the house door, and Gyp, instead of barking, as might have been expected, gave a loud howl. Adam, very much startled, went at once to the door and opened it. Nothing was there; all was still, as when he opened it an hour before; the leaves were motionless, and the light of the stars showed the placid fields on both sides of the brook quite empty of visible life. Adam walked round the house, and still saw nothing except a rat which darted into the woodshed as he passed. He went in again, wondering; the sound was so peculiar that the moment he heard it it called up the image of the willow wand striking the door. He could not help a little shudder, as he remembered how often his mother had told him of just such a sound coming as a sign when some one was dying. Adam was not a man to be gratuitously superstitious, but he had the blood of the peasant in him as well as of the artisan, and a peasant can no more help believing in a traditional superstition than a horse can help trembling when he sees a camel. Besides, he had that mental combination which is at once humble in the region of mystery and keen in the region of knowledge: it was the depth of his reverence quite as much as his hard common sense which gave him his disinclination to doctrinal religion, and he often checked Seth\u2019s argumentative spiritualism by saying, \u201cEh, it\u2019s a big mystery; thee know\u2019st but little about it.\u201d And so it happened that Adam was at once penetrating and credulous. If a new building had fallen down and he had been told that this was a divine judgment, he would have said, \u201cMay be; but the bearing o\u2019 the roof and walls wasn\u2019t right, else it wouldn\u2019t ha\u2019 come down\u201d; yet he believed in dreams and prognostics, and to his dying day he bated his breath a little when he told the story of the stroke with the willow wand. I tell it as he told it, not attempting to reduce it to its natural elements\u2014in our eagerness to explain impressions, we often lose our hold of the sympathy that comprehends them. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But he had the best antidote against imaginative dread in the necessity for getting on with the coffin, and for the next ten minutes his hammer was ringing so uninterruptedly, that other sounds, if there were any, might well be overpowered. A pause came, however, when he had to take up his ruler, and now again came the strange rap, and again Gyp howled. Adam was at the door without the loss of a moment; but again all was still, and the starlight showed there was nothing but the dew-laden grass in front of the cottage. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam for a moment thought uncomfortably about his father; but of late years he had never come home at dark hours from Treddleston, and there was every reason for believing that he was then sleeping off his drunkenness at the \u201cWaggon Overthrown.\u201d Besides, to Adam, the conception of the future was so inseparable from the painful image of his father that the fear of any fatal accident to him was excluded by the deeply infixed fear of his continual degradation. The next thought that occurred to him was one that made him slip off his shoes and tread lightly upstairs, to listen at the bedroom doors. But both Seth and his mother were breathing regularly. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam came down and set to work again, saying to himself, \u201cI won\u2019t open the door again. It\u2019s no use staring about to catch sight of a sound. Maybe there\u2019s a world about us as we can\u2019t see, but th\u2019 ear\u2019s quicker than the eye and catches a sound from\u2019t now and then. Some people think they get a sight on\u2019t too, but they\u2019re mostly folks whose eyes are not much use to \u2019em at anything else. For my part, I think it\u2019s better to see when your perpendicular\u2019s true than to see a ghost.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Such thoughts as these are apt to grow stronger and stronger as daylight quenches the candles and the birds begin to sing. By the time the red sunlight shone on the brass nails that formed the initials on the lid of the coffin, any lingering foreboding from the sound of the willow wand was merged in satisfaction that the work was done and the promise redeemed. There was no need to call Seth, for he was already moving overhead, and presently came downstairs. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow, lad,\u201d said Adam, as Seth made his appearance, \u201cthe coffin\u2019s done, and we can take it over to Brox\u2019on, and be back again before half after six. I\u2019ll take a mouthful o\u2019 oat-cake, and then we\u2019ll be off.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The coffin was soon propped on the tall shoulders of the two brothers, and they were making their way, followed close by Gyp, out of the little woodyard into the lane at the back of the house. It was but about a mile and a half to Broxton over the opposite slope, and their road wound very pleasantly along lanes and across fields, where the pale woodbines and the dog-roses were scenting the hedgerows, and the birds were twittering and trilling in the tall leafy boughs of oak and elm. It was a strangely mingled picture\u2014the fresh youth of the summer morning, with its Edenlike peace and loveliness, the stalwart strength of the two brothers in their rusty working clothes, and the long coffin on their shoulders. They paused for the last time before a small farmhouse outside the village of Broxton. By six o\u2019clock the task was done, the coffin nailed down, and Adam and Seth were on their way home. They chose a shorter way homewards, which would take them across the fields and the brook in front of the house. Adam had not mentioned to Seth what had happened in the night, but he still retained sufficient impression from it himself to say, \u201cSeth, lad, if Father isn\u2019t come home by the time we\u2019ve had our breakfast, I think it\u2019ll be as well for thee to go over to Treddles\u2019on and look after him, and thee canst get me the brass wire I want. Never mind about losing an hour at thy work; we can make that up. What dost say?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m willing,\u201d said Seth. \u201cBut see what clouds have gathered since we set out. I\u2019m thinking we shall have more rain. It\u2019ll be a sore time for th\u2019 haymaking if the meadows are flooded again. The brook\u2019s fine and full now: another day\u2019s rain \u2019ud cover the plank, and we should have to go round by the road.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  They were coming across the valley now, and had entered the pasture through which the brook ran. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, what\u2019s that sticking against the willow?\u201d continued Seth, beginning to walk faster. Adam\u2019s heart rose to his mouth: the vague anxiety about his father was changed into a great dread. He made no answer to Seth, but ran forward preceded by Gyp, who began to bark uneasily; and in two moments he was at the bridge. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  This was what the omen meant, then! And the grey-haired father, of whom he had thought with a sort of hardness a few hours ago, as certain to live to be a thorn in his side was perhaps even then struggling with that watery death! This was the first thought that flashed through Adam\u2019s conscience, before he had time to seize the coat and drag out the tall heavy body. Seth was already by his side, helping him, and when they had it on the bank, the two sons in the first moment knelt and looked with mute awe at the glazed eyes, forgetting that there was need for action\u2014forgetting everything but that their father lay dead before them. Adam was the first to speak. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ll run to Mother,\u201d he said, in a loud whisper. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to thee in a minute.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Poor Lisbeth was busy preparing her sons\u2019 breakfast, and their porridge was already steaming on the fire. Her kitchen always looked the pink of cleanliness, but this morning she was more than usually bent on making her hearth and breakfast-table look comfortable and inviting. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThe lads \u2019ull be fine an\u2019 hungry,\u201d she said, half-aloud, as she stirred the porridge. \u201cIt\u2019s a good step to Brox\u2019on, an\u2019 it\u2019s hungry air o\u2019er the hill\u2014wi\u2019 that heavy coffin too. Eh! It\u2019s heavier now, wi\u2019 poor Bob Tholer in\u2019t. Howiver, I\u2019ve made a drap more porridge nor common this mornin\u2019. The feyther \u2019ull happen come in arter a bit.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHush, Mother,\u201d Adam said, rather hoarsely, \u201cdon\u2019t be frightened. Father\u2019s tumbled into the water. Belike we may bring him round again.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He ran back to Seth, and the two sons lifted the sad burden in heart-stricken silence. The wide-open glazed eyes were grey, like Seth\u2019s, and had once looked with mild pride on the boys before whom Thias had lived to hang his head in shame. Seth\u2019s chief feeling was awe and distress at this sudden snatching away of his father\u2019s soul; but Adam\u2019s mind rushed back over the past in a flood of relenting and pity. When death, the great Reconciler, has come, it is never our tenderness that we repent of, but our severity."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

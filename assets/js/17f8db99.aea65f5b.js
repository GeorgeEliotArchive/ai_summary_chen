He said to himself that he was only doing right in telling her the truth about her husband\u2019s probable future, but he certainly thought also that it would be interesting to talk confidentially with her.

But now it occurred to her that they should be put out of her husband\u2019s sight: whatever might have been the sources of his annoyance about them, he must, if possible, not be annoyed again; and she ran her eyes first over the letter addressed to him to assure herself whether or not it would be necessary to write in order to hinder the offensive visit.

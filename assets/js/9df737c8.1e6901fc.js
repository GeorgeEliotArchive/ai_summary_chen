So it has been since the days of Hecuba, and of Hector, Tamer of horses; inside the gates, the women with streaming hair and uplifted hands offering prayers, watching the world\u2019s combat from afar, filling their long, empty days with memories and fears; outside, the men, in fierce struggle with things divine and human, quenching memory in the stronger light of purpose, losing the sense of dread and even of wounds in the hurrying ardor of action. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  From what you have seen of Tom, I think he is not a youth of whom you would prophesy failure in anything he had thoroughly wished; the wagers are likely to be on his side, notwithstanding his small success in the classics. For Tom had never desired success in this field of enterprise; and for getting a fine flourishing growth of stupidity there is nothing like pouring out on a mind a good amount of subjects in which it feels no interest. But now Tom\u2019s strong will bound together his integrity, his pride, his family regrets, and his personal ambition, and made them one force, concentrating his efforts and surmounting discouragements. His uncle Deane, who watched him closely, soon began to conceive hopes of him, and to be rather proud that he had brought into the employment of the firm a nephew who appeared to be made of such good commercial stuff. The real kindness of placing him in the warehouse first was soon evident to Tom, in the hints his uncle began to throw out, that after a time he might perhaps be trusted to travel at certain seasons, and buy in for the firm various vulgar commodities with which I need not shock refined ears in this place; and it was doubtless with a view to this result that Mr Deane, when he expected to take his wine alone, would tell Tom to step in and sit with him an hour, and would pass that hour in much lecturing and catechising concerning articles of export and import, with an occasional excursus of more indirect utility on the relative advantages to the merchants of St Ogg\u2019s of having goods brought in their own and in foreign bottoms,\u2014a subject on which Mr Deane, as a ship-owner, naturally threw off a few sparks when he got warmed with talk and wine. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Already, in the second year, Tom\u2019s salary was raised; but all, except the price of his dinner and clothes, went home into the tin box; and he shunned comradeship, lest it should lead him into expenses in spite of himself. Not that Tom was moulded on the spoony type of the Industrious Apprentice; he had a very strong appetite for pleasure,\u2014would have liked to be a Tamer of horses and to make a distinguished figure in all neighbouring eyes, dispensing treats and benefits to others with well-judged liberality, and being pronounced one of the finest young fellows of those parts; nay, he determined to achieve these things sooner or later; but his practical shrewdness told him that the means to such achievements could only lie for him in present abstinence and self-denial; there were certain milestones to be passed, and one of the first was the payment of his father\u2019s debts. Having made up his mind on that point, he strode along without swerving, contracting some rather saturnine sternness, as a young man is likely to do who has a premature call upon him for self-reliance. Tom felt intensely that common cause with his father which springs from family pride, and was bent on being irreproachable as a son; but his growing experience caused him to pass much silent criticism on the rashness and imprudence of his father\u2019s past conduct; their dispositions were not in sympathy, and Tom\u2019s face showed little radiance during his few home hours. Maggie had an awe of him, against which she struggled as something unfair to her consciousness of wider thoughts and deeper motives; but it was of no use to struggle. A character at unity with itself\u2014that performs what it intends, subdues every counteracting impulse, and has no visions beyond the distinctly possible\u2014is strong by its very negations. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  You may imagine that Tom\u2019s more and more obvious unlikeness to his father was well fitted to conciliate the maternal aunts and uncles; and Mr Deane\u2019s favourable reports and predictions to Mr Glegg concerning Tom\u2019s qualifications for business began to be discussed amongst them with various acceptance. He was likely, it appeared, to do the family credit without causing it any expense and trouble. Mrs Pullet had always thought it strange if Tom\u2019s excellent complexion, so entirely that of the Dodsons, did not argue a certainty that he would turn out well; his juvenile errors of running down the peacock, and general disrespect to his aunts, only indicating a tinge of Tulliver blood which he had doubtless outgrown. Mr Glegg, who had contracted a cautious liking for Tom ever since his spirited and sensible behaviour when the execution was in the house, was now warming into a resolution to further his prospects actively,\u2014some time, when an opportunity offered of doing so in a prudent manner, without ultimate loss; but Mrs Glegg observed that she was not given to speak without book, as some people were; that those who said least were most likely to find their words made good; and that when the right moment came, it would be seen who could do something better than talk. Uncle Pullet, after silent meditation for a period of several lozenges, came distinctly to the conclusion, that when a young man was likely to do well, it was better not to meddle with him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom, meanwhile, had shown no disposition to rely on any one but himself, though, with a natural sensitiveness toward all indications of favourable opinion, he was glad to see his uncle Glegg look in on him sometimes in a friendly way during business hours, and glad to be invited to dine at his house, though he usually preferred declining on the ground that he was not sure of being punctual. But about a year ago, something had occurred which induced Tom to test his uncle Glegg\u2019s friendly disposition. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Bob Jakin, who rarely returned from one of his rounds without seeing Tom and Maggie, awaited him on the bridge as he was coming home from St Ogg\u2019s one evening, that they might have a little private talk. He took the liberty of asking if Mr Tom had ever thought of making money by trading a bit on his own account. Trading, how? Tom wished to know. Why, by sending out a bit of a cargo to foreign ports; because Bob had a particular friend who had offered to do a little business for him in that way in Laceham goods, and would be glad to serve Mr Tom on the same footing. Tom was interested at once, and begged for full explanation, wondering he had not thought of this plan before. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He was so well pleased with the prospect of a speculation that might change the slow process of addition into multiplication, that he at once determined to mention the matter to his father, and get his consent to appropriate some of the savings in the tin box to the purchase of a small cargo. He would rather not have consulted his father, but he had just paid his last quarter\u2019s money into the tin box, and there was no other resource. All the savings were there; for Mr Tulliver would not consent to put the money out at interest lest he should lose it. Since he had speculated in the purchase of some corn, and had lost by it, he could not be easy without keeping the money under his eye. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom approached the subject carefully, as he was seated on the hearth with his father that evening, and Mr Tulliver listened, leaning forward in his arm-chair and looking up in Tom\u2019s face with a sceptical glance. His first impulse was to give a positive refusal, but he was in some awe of Tom\u2019s wishes, and since he had the sense of being an \u201cunlucky\u201d father, he had lost some of his old peremptoriness and determination to be master. He took the key of the bureau from his pocket, got out the key of the large chest, and fetched down the tin box,\u2014slowly, as if he were trying to defer the moment of a painful parting. Then he seated himself against the table, and opened the box with that little padlock-key which he fingered in his waistcoat pocket in all vacant moments. There they were, the dingy bank-notes and the bright sovereigns, and he counted them out on the table\u2014only a hundred and sixteen pounds in two years, after all the pinching. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHow much do you want, then?\u201d he said, speaking as if the words burnt his lips. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSuppose I begin with the thirty-six pounds, father?\u201d said Tom. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Tulliver separated this sum from the rest, and keeping his hand over it, said: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s as much as I can save out o\u2019 my pay in a year.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, father; it is such slow work, saving out of the little money we get. And in this way we might double our savings.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy, my lad,\u201d said the father, keeping his hand on the money, \u201cbut you might lose it,\u2014you might lose a year o\u2019 my life,\u2014and I haven\u2019t got many.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom was silent. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAnd you know I wouldn\u2019t pay a dividend with the first hundred, because I wanted to see it all in a lump,\u2014and when I see it, I\u2019m sure on\u2019t. If you trust to luck, it\u2019s sure to be against me. It\u2019s Old Harry\u2019s got the luck in his hands; and if I lose one year, I shall never pick it up again; death \u2019ull o\u2019ertake me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Tulliver\u2019s voice trembled, and Tom was silent for a few minutes before he said: "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ll give it up, father, since you object to it so strongly.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But, unwilling to abandon the scheme altogether, he determined to ask his uncle Glegg to venture twenty pounds, on condition of receiving five per cent. of the profits. That was really a very small thing to ask. So when Bob called the next day at the wharf to know the decision, Tom proposed that they should go together to his uncle Glegg\u2019s to open the business; for his diffident pride clung to him, and made him feel that Bobs\u2019 tongue would relieve him from some embarrassment. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Glegg, at the pleasant hour of four in the afternoon of a hot August day, was naturally counting his wall-fruit to assure himself that the sum total had not varied since yesterday. To him entered Tom, in what appeared to Mr Glegg very questionable companionship,\u2014that of a man with a pack on his back,\u2014for Bob was equipped for a new journey,\u2014and of a huge brindled bull-terrier, who walked with a slow, swaying movement from side to side, and glanced from under his eye-lids with a surly indifference which might after all be a cover to the most offensive designs. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Glegg\u2019s spectacles, which had been assisting him in counting the fruit, made these suspicious details alarmingly evident to him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHeigh! heigh! keep that dog back, will you?\u201d he shouted, snatching up a stake and holding it before him as a shield when the visitors were within three yards of him.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, what ever does this mean, Tom?\u201d said Mr Glegg. \u201cHave you brought information about the scoundrels as cut my trees?\u201d If Bob came in the character of \u201cinformation,\u201d Mr Glegg saw reasons for tolerating some irregularity. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said Tom; \u201cI came to speak to you about a little matter of business of my own.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAy\u2014well; but what has this dog got to do with it?\u201d said the old gentleman, getting mild again. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt\u2019s my dog, sir,\u201d said the ready Bob. \u201cAn\u2019 it\u2019s me as put Mr Tom up to the bit o\u2019 business; for Mr Tom\u2019s been a friend o\u2019 mine iver since I was a little chap; fust thing iver I did was frightenin\u2019 the birds for th\u2019 old master. An\u2019 if a bit o\u2019 luck turns up, I\u2019m allays thinkin\u2019 if I can let Mr Tom have a pull at it. An\u2019 it\u2019s a downright roarin\u2019 shame, as when he\u2019s got the chance o\u2019 making a bit o\u2019 money wi\u2019 sending goods out,\u2014ten or twelve per zent clear, when freight an\u2019 commission\u2019s paid,\u2014as he shouldn\u2019t lay hold o\u2019 the chance for want o\u2019 money. An\u2019 when there\u2019s the Laceham goods,\u2014lors! they\u2019re made o\u2019 purpose for folks as want to send out a little carguy; light, an\u2019 take up no room,\u2014you may pack twenty pound so as you can\u2019t see the passill; an\u2019 they\u2019re manifacturs as please fools, so I reckon they aren\u2019t like to want a market.

He looked at Bob, first over his spectacles, then through them, then over them again; while Tom, doubtful of his uncle\u2019s impression, began to wish he had not brought this singular Aaron, or mouthpiece. Bob\u2019s talk appeared less seemly, now some one besides himself was listening to it. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou seem to be a knowing fellow,\u201d said Mr Glegg, at last.

If I hadn\u2019t Mumps to talk to, I should get top-heavy an\u2019 tumble in a fit. I suppose it\u2019s because I niver went to school much. That\u2019s what I jaw my old mother for.

Lors, it\u2019s took me a deal o\u2019 study to know the vally o\u2019 such articles; when I begun to carry a pack, I was as ignirant as a pig; net or calico was all the same to me. I thought them things the most vally as was the thickest. I was took in dreadful, for I\u2019m a straightforrard chap,\u2014up to no tricks, mum.

When once his attention had been turned to this source of gain, Tom determined to make the most of it, and lost no opportunity of obtaining information and extending his small enterprises. In not telling his father, he was influenced by that strange mixture of opposite feelings which often gives equal truth to those who blame an action and those who admire it,\u2014partly, it was that disinclination to confidence which is seen between near kindred, that family repulsion which spoils the most sacred relations of our lives; partly, it was the desire to surprise his father with a great joy. He did not see that it would have been better to soothe the interval with a new hope, and prevent the delirium of a too sudden elation. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  At the time of Maggie\u2019s first meeting with Philip, Tom had already nearly a hundred and fifty pounds of his own capital; and while they were walking by the evening light in the Red Deeps, he, by the same evening light, was riding into Laceham, proud of being on his first journey on behalf of Guest & Co., and revolving in his mind all the chances that by the end of another year he should have doubled his gains, lifted off the obloquy of debt from his father\u2019s name, and perhaps\u2014for he should be twenty-one\u2014have got a new start for himself, on a higher platform of employment. Did he not desire it? He was quite sure that he did."))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

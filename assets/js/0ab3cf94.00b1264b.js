Yesterday he would have said to her without any difficulty, \u201cI came to see you, Dinah: I knew the rest were not at home.\u201d But to-day something prevented him from saying that, and he put out his hand to her in silence. Neither of them spoke, and yet both wished they could speak, as Adam entered, and they sat down. Dinah took the chair she had just left; it was at the corner of the table near the window, and there was a book lying on the table, but it was not open. She had been sitting perfectly still, looking at the small bit of clear fire in the bright grate. Adam sat down opposite her, in Mr. Poyser\u2019s three-cornered chair.

But the frankness of the words caused her immediately to interpret them into a renewal of his brotherly regrets that she was going away, and she answered calmly, \u201cDo not be careful and troubled for me, Adam. I have all things and abound at Snowfield.

I fear I should forget to rejoice and weep with others; nay, I fear I should forget the Divine presence, and seek no love but yours.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam did not speak immediately. They sat looking at each other in delicious silence\u2014for the first sense of mutual love excludes other feelings; it will have the soul all to itself.

I\u2019d never think o\u2019 putting myself between you and God, and saying you oughtn\u2019t to do this and you oughtn\u2019t to do that.

Those have been very blessed years to me, and I feel that if I was to listen to any voice that would draw me aside from that path, I should be turning my back on the light that has shone upon me, and darkness and doubt would take hold of me. We could not bless each other, Adam, if there were doubts in my soul, and if I yearned, when it was too late, after that better part which had once been given me and I had put away from me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut if a new feeling has come into your mind, Dinah, and if you love me so as to be willing to be nearer to me than to other people, isn\u2019t that a sign that it\u2019s right for you to change your life? Doesn\u2019t the love make it right when nothing else would?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAdam, my mind is full of questionings about that; for now, since you tell me of your strong love towards me, what was clear to me has become dark again. I felt before that my heart was too strongly drawn towards you, and that your heart was not as mine; and the thought of you had taken hold of me, so that my soul had lost its freedom, and was becoming enslaved to an earthly affection, which made me anxious and careful about what should befall myself. For in all other affection I had been content with any small return, or with none; but my heart was beginning to hunger after an equal love from you. And I had no doubt that I must wrestle against that as a great temptation, and the command was clear that I must go away.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut now, dear, dear Dinah, now you know I love you better than you love me... it\u2019s all different now. You won\u2019t think o\u2019 going. You\u2019ll stay, and be my dear wife, and I shall thank God for giving me my life as I never thanked him before.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAdam, it\u2019s hard to me to turn a deaf ear... you know it\u2019s hard; but a great fear is upon me. It seems to me as if you were stretching out your arms to me, and beckoning me to come and take my ease and live for my own delight, and Jesus, the Man of Sorrows, was standing looking towards me, and pointing to the sinful, and suffering, and afflicted. I have seen that again and again when I have been sitting in stillness and darkness, and a great terror has come upon me lest I should become hard, and a lover of self, and no more bear willingly the Redeemer\u2019s cross.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Dinah had closed her eyes, and a faint shudder went through her. \u201cAdam,\u201d she went on, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t desire that we should seek a good through any unfaithfulness to the light that is in us; you wouldn\u2019t believe that could be a good. We are of one mind in that.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, Dinah,\u201d said Adam sadly, \u201cI\u2019ll never be the man t\u2019 urge you against your conscience. But I can\u2019t give up the hope that you may come to see different. I don\u2019t believe your loving me could shut up your heart\u2014it\u2019s only adding to what you\u2019ve been before, not taking away from it. For it seems to me it\u2019s the same with love and happiness as with sorrow\u2014the more we know of it the better we can feel what other people\u2019s lives are or might be, and so we shall only be more tender to \u2019em, and wishful to help \u2019em. The more knowledge a man has, the better he\u2019ll do\u2019s work; and feeling\u2019s a sort o\u2019 knowledge.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Dinah was silent; her eyes were fixed in contemplation of something visible only to herself. Adam went on presently with his pleading, \u201cAnd you can do almost as much as you do now. I won\u2019t ask you to go to church with me of a Sunday. You shall go where you like among the people, and teach \u2019em; for though I like church best, I don\u2019t put my soul above yours, as if my words was better for you to follow than your own conscience. And you can help the sick just as much, and you\u2019ll have more means o\u2019 making \u2019em a bit comfortable; and you\u2019ll be among all your own friends as love you, and can help \u2019em and be a blessing to \u2019em till their dying day. Surely, Dinah, you\u2019d be as near to God as if you was living lonely and away from me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Dinah made no answer for some time. Adam was still holding her hands and looking at her with almost trembling anxiety, when she turned her grave loving eyes on his and said, in rather a sad voice, \u201cAdam there is truth in what you say, and there\u2019s many of the brethren and sisters who have greater strength than I have, and find their hearts enlarged by the cares of husband and kindred. But I have not faith that it would be so with me, for since my affections have been set above measure on you, I have had less peace and joy in God. I have felt as it were a division in my heart. And think how it is with me, Adam. That life I have led is like a land I have trodden in blessedness since my childhood; and if I long for a moment to follow the voice which calls me to another land that I know not, I cannot but fear that my soul might hereafter yearn for that early blessedness which I had forsaken; and where doubt enters there is not perfect love. I must wait for clearer guidance. I must go from you, and we must submit ourselves entirely to the Divine Will. We are sometimes required to lay our natural lawful affections on the altar.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam dared not plead again, for Dinah\u2019s was not the voice of caprice or insincerity. But it was very hard for him; his eyes got dim as he looked at her. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut you may come to feel satisfied... to feel that you may come to me again, and we may never part, Dinah?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWe must submit ourselves, Adam. With time, our duty will be made clear. It may be when I have entered on my former life, I shall find all these new thoughts and wishes vanish, and become as things that were not. Then I shall know that my calling is not towards marriage. But we must wait.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDinah,\u201d said Adam mournfully, \u201cyou can\u2019t love me so well as I love you, else you\u2019d have no doubts. But it\u2019s natural you shouldn\u2019t, for I\u2019m not so good as you. I can\u2019t doubt it\u2019s right for me to love the best thing God\u2019s ever given me to know.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, Adam. It seems to me that my love for you is not weak, for my heart waits on your words and looks, almost as a little child waits on the help and tenderness of the strong on whom it depends. If the thought of you took slight hold of me, I should not fear that it would be an idol in the temple. But you will strengthen me\u2014you will not hinder me in seeking to obey to the uttermost.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cLet us go out into the sunshine, Dinah, and walk together.

Adam said, \u201cTake my arm, Dinah,\u201d and she took it. That was the only change in their manner to each other since they were last walking together. But no sadness in the prospect of her going away\u2014in the uncertainty of the issue\u2014could rob the sweetness from Adam\u2019s sense that Dinah loved him. He thought he would stay at the Hall Farm all that evening. He would be near her as long as he could. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHey-day!

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Surely all other leisure is hurry compared with a sunny walk through the fields from \u201cafternoon church\u201d\u2014as such walks used to be in those old leisurely times, when the boat, gliding sleepily along the canal, was the newest locomotive wonder; when Sunday books had most of them old brown-leather covers, and opened with remarkable precision always in one place. Leisure is gone\u2014gone where the spinning-wheels are gone, and the pack-horses, and the slow waggons, and the pedlars, who brought bargains to the door on sunny afternoons. Ingenious philosophers tell you, perhaps, that the great work of the steam-engine is to create leisure for mankind. Do not believe them: it only creates a vacuum for eager thought to rush in. Even idleness is eager now\u2014eager for amusement; prone to excursion-trains, art museums, periodical literature, and exciting novels; prone even to scientific theorizing and cursory peeps through microscopes. Old Leisure was quite a different personage. He only read one newspaper, innocent of leaders, and was free from that periodicity of sensations which we call post-time. He was a contemplative, rather stout gentleman, of excellent digestion; of quiet perceptions, undiseased by hypothesis; happy in his inability to know the causes of things, preferring the things themselves. He lived chiefly in the country, among pleasant seats and homesteads, and was fond of sauntering by the fruit-tree wall and scenting the apricots when they were warmed by the morning sunshine, or of sheltering himself under the orchard boughs at noon, when the summer pears were falling. He knew nothing of weekday services, and thought none the worse of the Sunday sermon if it allowed him to sleep from the text to the blessing; liking the afternoon service best, because the prayers were the shortest, and not ashamed to say so; for he had an easy, jolly conscience, broad-backed like himself, and able to carry a great deal of beer or port-wine, not being made squeamish by doubts and qualms and lofty aspirations. Life was not a task to him, but a sinecure. He fingered the guineas in his pocket, and ate his dinners, and slept the sleep of the irresponsible, for had he not kept up his character by going to church on the Sunday afternoons?

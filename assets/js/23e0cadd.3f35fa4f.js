His arms\u2014an azure ladder transverse on a golden field, with the motto ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Gradatim")," placed over the entrance\u2014told all comers that the miller\u2019s son held his ascent to honours by his own efforts a fact to be proclaimed without wincing. The secretary was a vain and pompous man, but he was also an honest one: he was sincerely convinced of his own merit, and could see no reason for feigning. The topmost round of his azure ladder had been reached by this time: he had held his secretaryship these twenty years\u2014had long since made his orations on the ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"ringhiera"),", or platform of the Old Palace, as the custom was, in the presence of princely visitors, while Marzocco, the republican lion, wore his gold crown on the occasion, and all the people cried, \u201cViva Messer Bartolommeo!\u201d\u2014had been on an embassy to Rome, and had there been made titular Senator, Apostolical Secretary, Knight of the Golden Spur; and had, eight years ago, been Gonfaloniere\u2014last goal of the Florentine citizen\u2019s ambition. Meantime he had got richer and richer, and more and more gouty, after the manner of successful mortality; and the Knight of the Golden Spur had often to sit with helpless cushioned heel under the handsome loggia he had built for himself, overlooking the spacious gardens and lawn at the back of his palace. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"He was in this position on the day when he had granted the desired interview to Tito Melema. The May afternoon sun was on the flowers and the grass beyond the pleasant shade of the loggia; the too stately silk lucco was cast aside, and the light loose mantle was thrown over his tunic; his beautiful daughter Alessandra and her husband, the Greek soldier-poet Marullo, were seated on one side of him: on the other, two friends not oppressively illustrious, and therefore the better listeners. Yet, to say nothing of the gout, Messer Bartolommeo\u2019s felicity was far from perfect: it was embittered by the contents of certain papers that lay before him, consisting chiefly of a correspondence between himself and Politian. It was a human foible at that period (incredible as it may seem) to recite quarrels, and favour scholarly visitors with the communication of an entire and lengthy correspondence; and this was neither the first nor the second time that Scala had asked the candid opinion of his friends as to the balance of right and wrong in some half-score Latin letters between himself and Politian, all springing out of certain epigrams written in the most playful tone in the world. It was the story of a very typical and pretty quarrel, in which we are interested, because it supplied precisely that thistle of hatred necessary, according to Nello, as a stimulus to the sluggish paces of the cautious steed, Friendship. Politian, having been a rejected pretender to the love and the hand of Scala\u2019s daughter, kept a very sharp and learned tooth in readiness against the too prosperous and presumptuous secretary, who had declined the greatest scholar of the age for a son-in-law. Scala was a meritorious public servant, and, moreover, a lucky man\u2014naturally exasperating to an offended scholar; but then\u2014O beautiful balance of things!\u2014he had an itch for authorship, and was a bad writer\u2014one of those excellent people who, sitting in gouty slippers, \u201cpenned poetical trifles\u201d entirely for their own amusement, without any view to an audience, and, consequently, sent them to their friends in letters, which were the literary periodicals of the fifteenth century. Now Scala had abundance of friends who were ready to praise his writings: friends like Ficino and Landino\u2014amiable browsers in the Medicean park along with himself\u2014who found his Latin prose style elegant and masculine; and the terrible Joseph Scaliger, who was to pronounce him totally ignorant of Latinity, was at a comfortable distance in the next century. But when was the fatal coquetry inherent in superfluous authorship ever quite contented with the ready praise of friends? That critical supercilious Politian\u2014a fellow-browser, who was far from amiable\u2014must be made aware that the solid secretary showed, in his leisure hours, a pleasant fertility in verses, which indicated pretty clearly how much he might do in that way if he were not a man of affairs. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Ineffable moment! when the man you secretly hate sends you a Latin epigram with a false gender\u2014hendecasyllables with a questionable elision, at least a toe too much\u2014attempts at poetic figures which are manifest solecisms. That moment had come to Politian: the secretary had put forth his soft head from the official shell, and the terrible lurking crab was down upon him. Politian had used the freedom of a friend, and pleasantly, in the form of a Latin epigram, corrected the mistake of Scala in making the ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"culex")," (an insect too well-known on the banks of the Arno) of the inferior or feminine gender. Scala replied by a bad joke, in suitable Latin verses, referring to Politian\u2019s unsuccessful suit. Better and better. Politian found the verses very pretty and highly facetious: the more was the pity that they were seriously incorrect, and inasmuch as Scala had alleged that he had written them in imitation of a Greek epigram, Politian, being on such friendly terms, would enclose a Greek epigram of his own, on the same interesting insect\u2014not, we may presume, out of any wish to humble Scala, but rather to instruct him; said epigram containing a lively conceit about Venus, Cupid, and the ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"culex"),", of a kind much tasted at that period, founded partly on the zoological fact that the gnat, like Venus, was born from the waters. Scala, in reply, begged to say that his verses were never intended for a scholar with such delicate olfactories as Politian, nearest of all living men to the perfection of the ancients, and of a taste so fastidious that sturgeon itself must seem insipid to him; defended his own verses, nevertheless, though indeed they were written hastily, without correction, and intended as an agreeable distraction during the summer heat to himself and such friends as were satisfied with mediocrity, he, Scala, not being like some other people, who courted publicity through the booksellers. For the rest, he had barely enough Greek to make out the sense of the epigram so graciously sent him, to say nothing of tasting its elegances; but\u2014the epigram was Politian\u2019s: what more need be said? Still, by way of postscript, he feared that his incomparable friend\u2019s comparison of the gnat to Venus, on account of its origin from the waters, was in many ways ticklish. On the one hand, Venus might be offended; and on the other, unless the poet intended an allusion to the doctrine of Thales, that cold and damp origin seemed doubtful to Scala in the case of a creature so fond of warmth; a fish were perhaps the better comparison, or, when the power of flying was in question, an eagle, or indeed, when the darkness was taken into consideration, a bat or an owl were a less obscure and more apposite parallel, etcetera, etcetera. Here was a great opportunity for Politian. He was not aware, he wrote, that when he had Scala\u2019s verses placed before him, there was any question of sturgeon, but rather of frogs and gudgeons: made short work with Scala\u2019s defence of his own Latin, and mangled him terribly on the score of the stupid criticisms he had ventured on the Greek epigram kindly forwarded to him as a model. Wretched cavils, indeed! for as to the damp origin of the gnat, there was the authority of Virgil himself, who had called it the \u201c",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"alumnus")," of the waters;\u201d and as to what his dear dull friend had to say about the fish, the eagle, and the rest, it was \u201cnihil ad rem;\u201d for because the eagle could fly higher, it by no means followed that the gnat could not fly at all, etcetera, etcetera. He was ashamed, however, to dwell on such trivialities, and thus to swell a gnat into an elephant; but, for his own part, would only add that he had nothing deceitful or double about him, neither was he to be caught when present by the false blandishments of those who slandered him in his absence, agreeing rather with a Homeric sentiment on that head\u2014which furnished a Greek quotation to serve as powder to his bullet. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"The quarrel could not end there. The logic could hardly get worse, but the secretary got more pompously self-asserting, and the scholarly poet\u2019s temper more and more venomous. Politian had been generously willing to hold up a mirror, by which the too-inflated secretary, beholding his own likeness, might be induced to cease setting up his ignorant defences of bad Latin against ancient authorities whom the consent of centuries had placed beyond question,\u2014unless, indeed, he had designed to sink in literature in proportion as he rose in honours, that by a sort of compensation men of letters might feel themselves his equals. In return, Politian was begged to examine Scala\u2019s writings: nowhere would he find a more devout admiration of antiquity. The secretary was ashamed of the age in which he lived, and blushed for it. ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Some"),", indeed, there were who wanted to have their own works praised and exalted to a level with the divine monuments of antiquity; but he, Scala, could not oblige them. And as to the honours which were offensive to the envious, they had been well earned: witness his whole life since he came in penury to Florence. The elegant scholar, in reply, was not surprised that Scala found the Age distasteful to him, since he himself was so distasteful to the Age; nay, it was with perfect accuracy that he, the elegant scholar, had called Scala a branny monster, inasmuch as he was formed from the off-scourings of monsters, born amidst the refuse of a mill, and eminently worthy the long-eared office of turning the paternal millstones (",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"in pistrini sordibus natus et quidem pistrino dignissimus"),")! "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"It was not without reference to Tito\u2019s appointed visit that the papers containing this correspondence were brought out to-day. Here was a new Greek scholar whose accomplishments were to be tested, and on nothing did Scala more desire a dispassionate opinion from persons of superior knowledge than on that Greek epigram of Politian\u2019s. After sufficient introductory talk concerning Tito\u2019s travels, after a survey and discussion of the gems, and an easy passage from the mention of the lamented Lorenzo\u2019s eagerness in collecting such specimens of ancient art to the subject of classical tastes and studies in general and their present condition in Florence, it was inevitable to mention Politian, a man of eminent ability indeed, but a little too arrogant\u2014assuming to be a Hercules, whose office it was to destroy all the literary monstrosities of the age, and writing letters to his elders without signing them, as if they were miraculous revelations that could only have one source. And after all, were not his own criticisms often questionable and his tastes perverse? He was fond of saying pungent things about the men who thought they wrote like Cicero because they ended every sentence with \u201cesse videtur:\u201d but while he was boasting of his freedom from servile imitation, did he not fall into the other extreme, running after strange words and affected phrases? Even in his much-belauded \u2018Miscellanea\u2019 was every point tenable? And Tito, who had just been looking into the \u2018Miscellanea,\u2019 found so much to say that was agreeable to the secretary\u2014he would have done so from the mere disposition to please, without further motive\u2014that he showed himself quite worthy to be made a judge in the notable correspondence concerning the ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"culex"),". Here was the Greek epigram which Politian had doubtless thought the finest in the world, though he had pretended to believe that the \u201ctransmarini,\u201d the Greeks themselves, would make light of it: had he not been unintentionally speaking the truth in his false modesty? "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Tito was ready, and scarified the epigram to Scala\u2019s content. O wise young judge! He could doubtless appreciate satire even in the vulgar tongue, and Scala\u2014who, excellent man, not seeking publicity through the booksellers, was never unprovided with \u201chasty uncorrected trifles,\u201d as a sort of sherbet for a visitor on a hot day, or, if the weather were cold, why then as a cordial\u2014had a few little matters in the shape of Sonnets, turning on well-known foibles of Politian\u2019s, which he would not like to go any farther, but which would, perhaps, amuse the company.

His gems were interesting; especially the agate, with the ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"lusus naturae")," in it\u2014a most wonderful semblance of Cupid riding on the lion; and the \u201cJew\u2019s stone,\u201d with the lion-headed serpent enchased in it; both of which the secretary agreed to buy\u2014the latter as a reinforcement of his preventives against the gout, which gave him such severe twinges that it was plain enough how intolerable it would be if he were not well supplied with rings of rare virtue, and with an amulet worn close under the right breast. But Tito was assured that he himself was more interesting than his gems. He had won his way to the Scala Palace by the recommendation of Bardo de\u2019 Bardi, who, to be sure, was Scala\u2019s old acquaintance and a worthy scholar, in spite of his overvaluing himself a little (a frequent foible in the secretary\u2019s friends); but he must come again on the ground of his own manifest accomplishments.

He was not lodging with entire strangers. Our friend Bob Jakin had, with Mumps\u2019s tacit consent, taken not only a wife about eight months ago, but also one of those queer old houses, pierced with surprising passages, by the water-side, where, as he observed, his wife and mother could keep themselves out of mischief by letting out two \u201cpleasure-boats,\u201d in which he had invested some of his savings, and by taking in a lodger for the parlour and spare bedroom. Under these circumstances, what could be better for the interests of all parties, sanitary considerations apart, than that the lodger should be Mr Tom? "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  It was Bob\u2019s wife who opened the door to Maggie. She was a tiny woman, with the general physiognomy of a Dutch doll, looking, in comparison with Bob\u2019s mother, who filled up the passage in the rear, very much like one of those human figures which the artist finds conveniently standing near a colossal statue to show the proportions. The tiny woman curtsied and looked up at Maggie with some awe as soon as she had opened the door; but the words, \u201cIs my brother at home?\u201d which Maggie uttered smilingly, made her turn round with sudden excitement, and say,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cEh, mother, mother\u2014tell Bob!\u2014it\u2019s Miss Maggie! Come in, Miss, for goodness do,\u201d she went on, opening a side door, and endeavoring to flatten her person against the wall to make the utmost space for the visitor. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Sad recollections crowded on Maggie as she entered the small parlour, which was now all that poor Tom had to call by the name of \u201chome,\u201d\u2014that name which had once, so many years ago, meant for both of them the same sum of dear familiar objects. But everything was not strange to her in this new room; the first thing her eyes dwelt on was the large old Bible, and the sight was not likely to disperse the old memories. She stood without speaking. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIf you please to take the privilege o\u2019 sitting down, Miss,\u201d said Mrs Jakin, rubbing her apron over a perfectly clean chair, and then lifting up the corner of that garment and holding it to her face with an air of embarrassment, as she looked wonderingly at Maggie. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBob is at home, then?\u201d said Maggie, recovering herself, and smiling at the bashful Dutch doll. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, Miss; but I think he must be washing and dressing himself; I\u2019ll go and see,\u201d said Mrs Jakin, disappearing.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHow do you do, Bob?\u201d said Maggie, coming forward and putting out her hand to him; \u201cI always meant to pay your wife a visit, and I shall come another day on purpose for that, if she will let me.

But about Mr Tom, Miss,\u201d said Bob, speaking lower and looking serious, \u201che\u2019s as close as a iron biler, he is; but I\u2019m a \u2019cutish chap, an\u2019 when I\u2019ve left off carrying my pack, an\u2019 am at a loose end, I\u2019ve got more brains nor I know what to do wi\u2019, an\u2019 I\u2019m forced to busy myself wi\u2019 other folks\u2019s insides.

He should be a bit livelier now, a fine young fellow like him. My wife says, when she goes in sometimes, an\u2019 he takes no notice of her, he sits lookin\u2019 into the fire, and frownin\u2019 as if he was watchin\u2019 folks at work in it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHe thinks so much about business,\u201d said Maggie.

He\u2019s close, Mr Tom is; but I\u2019m a \u2019cute chap, I am, an\u2019 I thought tow\u2019rt last Christmas as I\u2019d found out a soft place in him. It was about a little black spaniel\u2014a rare bit o\u2019 breed\u2014as he made a fuss to get. But since then summat\u2019s come over him, as he\u2019s set his teeth again\u2019 things more nor iver, for all he\u2019s had such good luck. An\u2019 I wanted to tell ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you"),", Miss, \u2019cause I thought you might work it out of him a bit, now you\u2019re come. He\u2019s a deal too lonely, and doesn\u2019t go into company enough.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have very little power over him, Bob,\u201d said Maggie, a good deal moved by Bob\u2019s suggestion. It was a totally new idea to her mind that Tom could have his love troubles. Poor fellow!\u2014and in love with Lucy too! But it was perhaps a mere fancy of Bob\u2019s too officious brain. The present of the dog meant nothing more than cousinship and gratitude. But Bob had already said, \u201cHere\u2019s Mr Tom,\u201d and the outer door was opening. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere is no time to spare, Tom,\u201d said Maggie, as soon as Bob left the room. \u201cI must tell you at once what I came about, else I shall be hindering you from taking your dinner.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom stood with his back against the chimney-piece, and Maggie was seated opposite the light. He noticed that she was tremulous, and he had a presentiment of the subject she was going to speak about. The presentiment made his voice colder and harder as he said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  This tone roused a spirit of resistance in Maggie, and she put her request in quite a different form from the one she had predetermined on. She rose from her seat, and looking straight at Tom, said,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI want you to absolve me from my promise about Philip Wakem. Or rather, I promised you not to see him without telling you. I am come to tell you that I wish to see him.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cVery well,\u201d said Tom, still more coldly. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But Maggie had hardly finished speaking in that chill, defiant manner, before she repented, and felt the dread of alienation from her brother. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNot for myself, dear Tom. Don\u2019t be angry. I shouldn\u2019t have asked it, only that Philip, you know, is a friend of Lucy\u2019s and she wishes him to come, has invited him to come this evening; and I told her I couldn\u2019t see him without telling you. I shall only see him in the presence of other people. There will never be anything secret between us again.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Tom looked away from Maggie, knitting his brow more strongly for a little while. Then he turned to her and said, slowly and emphatically,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou know what is my feeling on that subject, Maggie. There is no need for my repeating anything I said a year ago. While my father was living, I felt bound to use the utmost power over you, to prevent you from disgracing him as well as yourself, and all of us. But now I must leave you to your own choice. You wish to be independent; you told me so after my father\u2019s death. My opinion is not changed. If you think of Philip Wakem as a lover again, you must give up me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI don\u2019t wish it, dear Tom, at least as things are; I see that it would lead to misery. But I shall soon go away to another situation, and I should like to be friends with him again while I am here. Lucy wishes it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The severity of Tom\u2019s face relaxed a little. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI shouldn\u2019t mind your seeing him occasionally at my uncle\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t want you to make a fuss on the subject. But I have no confidence in you, Maggie. You would be led away to do anything.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  That was a cruel word. Maggie\u2019s lip began to tremble. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy will you say that, Tom? It is very hard of you. Have I not done and borne everything as well as I could? And I kept my word to you\u2014when\u2014when\u2014\u2014My life has not been a happy one, any more than yours.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  She was obliged to be childish; the tears would come. When Maggie was not angry, she was as dependent on kind or cold words as a daisy on the sunshine or the cloud; the need of being loved would always subdue her, as, in old days, it subdued her in the worm-eaten attic. The brother\u2019s goodness came uppermost at this appeal, but it could only show itself in Tom\u2019s fashion. He put his hand gently on her arm, and said, in the tone of a kind pedagogue,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNow listen to me, Maggie. I\u2019ll tell you what I mean. You\u2019re always in extremes; you have no judgment and self-command; and yet you think you know best, and will not submit to be guided. You know I didn\u2019t wish you to take a situation. My aunt Pullet was willing to give you a good home, and you might have lived respectably amongst your relations, until I could have provided a home for you with my mother. And that is what I should like to do. I wished my sister to be a lady, and I always have taken care of you, as my father desired, until you were well married. But your ideas and mine never accord, and you will not give way. Yet you might have sense enough to see that a brother, who goes out into the world and mixes with men, necessarily knows better what is right and respectable for his sister than she can know herself. You think I am not kind; but my kindness can only be directed by what I believe to be good for you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, I know, dear Tom,\u201d said Maggie, still half-sobbing, but trying to control her tears. \u201cI know you would do a great deal for me; I know how you work, and don\u2019t spare yourself. I am grateful to you. But, indeed, you can\u2019t quite judge for me; our natures are very different. You don\u2019t know how differently things affect me from what they do you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, I ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"do")," know; I know it too well. I know how differently you must feel about all that affects our family, and your own dignity as a young woman, before you could think of receiving secret addresses from Philip Wakem. If it was not disgusting to me in every other way, I should object to my sister\u2019s name being associated for a moment with that of a young man whose father must hate the very thought of us all, and would spurn you. With any one but you, I should think it quite certain that what you witnessed just before my father\u2019s death would secure you from ever thinking again of Philip Wakem as a lover. But I don\u2019t feel certain of it with you; I never feel certain about anything with ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"you"),". At one time you take pleasure in a sort of perverse self-denial, and at another you have not resolution to resist a thing that you know to be wrong.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There was a terrible cutting truth in Tom\u2019s words,\u2014that hard rind of truth which is discerned by unimaginative, unsympathetic minds. Maggie always writhed under this judgment of Tom\u2019s; she rebelled and was humiliated in the same moment; it seemed as if he held a glass before her to show her her own folly and weakness, as if he were a prophetic voice predicting her future fallings; and yet, all the while, she judged him in return; she said inwardly that he was narrow and unjust, that he was below feeling those mental needs which were often the source of the wrong-doing or absurdity that made her life a planless riddle to him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  She did not answer directly; her heart was too full, and she sat down, leaning her arm on the table. It was no use trying to make Tom feel that she was near to him. He always repelled her. Her feeling under his words was complicated by the allusion to the last scene between her father and Wakem; and at length that painful, solemn memory surmounted the immediate grievance. No! She did not think of such things with frivolous indifference, and Tom must not accuse her of that. She looked up at him with a grave, earnest gaze and said,\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI can\u2019t make you think better of me, Tom, by anything I can say. But I am not so shut out from all your feelings as you believe me to be. I see as well as you do that from our position with regard to Philip\u2019s father\u2014not on other grounds\u2014it would be unreasonable, it would be wrong, for us to entertain the idea of marriage; and I have given up thinking of him as a lover. I am telling you the truth, and you have no right to disbelieve me; I have kept my word to you, and you have never detected me in a falsehood. I should not only not encourage, I should carefully avoid, any intercourse with Philip on any other footing than of quiet friendship. You may think that I am unable to keep my resolutions; but at least you ought not to treat me with hard contempt on the ground of faults that I have not committed yet.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, Maggie,\u201d said Tom, softening under this appeal, \u201cI don\u2019t want to overstrain matters. I think, all things considered, it will be best for you to see Philip Wakem, if Lucy wishes him to come to the house. I believe what you say,\u2014at least you believe it yourself, I know; I can only warn you. I wish to be as good a brother to you as you will let me.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There was a little tremor in Tom\u2019s voice as he uttered the last words, and Maggie\u2019s ready affection came back with as sudden a glow as when they were children, and bit their cake together as a sacrament of conciliation. She rose and laid her hand on Tom\u2019s shoulder. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDear Tom, I know you mean to be good. I know you have had a great deal to bear, and have done a great deal.

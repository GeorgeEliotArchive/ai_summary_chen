Happily he was not so; he was only susceptible in respect of his right to water-power; moreover, he had the marital habit of not listening very closely, and since his mention of Mr Riley, had been apparently occupied in a tactile examination of his woollen stockings.

But them fine-talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirt-fronts; they wear a frill till it\u2019s all a mess, and then hide it with a bib; I know Riley does. And then, if Tom\u2019s to go and live at Mudport, like Riley, he\u2019ll have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in, an\u2019 niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast, an\u2019 sleep up three pair o\u2019 stairs,\u2014or four, for what I know,\u2014and be burnt to death before he can get down.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, no,\u201d said Mr Tulliver, \u201cI\u2019ve no thoughts of his going to Mudport: I mean him to set up his office at St Ogg\u2019s, close by us, an\u2019 live at home.

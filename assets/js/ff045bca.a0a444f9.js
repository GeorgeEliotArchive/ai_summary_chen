He had lain so still, with his eyes closed, all this morning, that Maggie told her aunt Moss she must not expect her father to take any notice of them. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  They entered very quietly, and Mrs Moss took her seat near the head of the bed, while Maggie sat in her old place on the bed, and put her hand on her father\u2019s without causing any change in his face. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr Glegg and Tom had also entered, treading softly, and were busy selecting the key of the old oak chest from the bunch which Tom had brought from his father\u2019s bureau. They succeeded in opening the chest,\u2014which stood opposite the foot of Mr Tulliver\u2019s bed,\u2014and propping the lid with the iron holder, without much noise.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Perhaps there was something in that sound more than the mere fact of the strong vibration that produced the instantaneous effect on the frame of the prostrate man, and for the time completely shook off the obstruction of paralysis. The chest had belonged to his father and his father\u2019s father, and it had always been rather a solemn business to visit it. All long-known objects, even a mere window fastening or a particular door-latch, have sounds which are a sort of recognised voice to us,\u2014a voice that will thrill and awaken, when it has been used to touch deep-lying fibres. In the same moment, when all the eyes in the room were turned upon him, he started up and looked at the chest, the parchments in Mr Glegg\u2019s hand, and Tom holding the tin box, with a glance of perfect consciousness and recognition. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat are you going to do with those deeds?\u201d he said, in his ordinary tone of sharp questioning whenever he was irritated. \u201cCome here, Tom.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat\u2019s been happening, then?\u201d he said sharply. \u201cWhat are you meddling with my deeds for? Is Wakem laying hold of everything?

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, no, friend Tulliver,\u201d said Mr Glegg, in a soothing tone. \u201cNobody\u2019s getting hold of anything as yet.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cEh, Gritty!\u201d he said, in the half-sad, affectionate tone in which he had been wont to speak to her. \u201cWhat! you\u2019re there, are you?

A new shadow came over his face. He looked up at Maggie first, and said in a lower tone, \u201cYou got the letter, then, my wench?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, father,\u201d she said, kissing him with a full heart.

Mr Glegg wanted to say something soothing, but he was prevented by Mr Tulliver\u2019s speaking again to his wife. \u201cThey\u2019ll make a shift to pay everything, Bessy,\u201d he said, \u201cand yet leave you your furniture; and your sisters\u2019ll do something for you\u2014and Tom\u2019ll grow up\u2014though what he\u2019s to be I don\u2019t know\u2014I\u2019ve done what I could\u2014I\u2019ve given him a eddication\u2014and there\u2019s the little wench, she\u2019ll get married\u2014but it\u2019s a poor tale\u2014\u2014\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The sanative effect of the strong vibration was exhausted, and with the last words the poor man fell again, rigid and insensible. Though this was only a recurrence of what had happened before, it struck all present as if it had been death, not only from its contrast with the completeness of the revival, but because his words had all had reference to the possibility that his death was near. But with poor Tulliver death was not to be a leap; it was to be a long descent under thickening shadows.

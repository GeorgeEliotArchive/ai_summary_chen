She always cited it afterwards as a case of prevision, which really had something more in it than her own remarkable penetration, that the moment she set eyes on the squire she said to herself, \u201cI shouldna wonder if he\u2019s come about that man as is a-going to take the Chase Farm, wanting Poyser to do something for him without pay.

Now, the plan I\u2019m thinking of is to effect a little exchange. If you were to have the Hollow Pastures, you might increase your dairy, which must be so profitable under your wife\u2019s management; and I should request you, Mrs. Poyser, to supply my house with milk, cream, and butter at the market prices. On the other hand, Poyser, you might let Thurle have the Lower and Upper Ridges, which really, with our wet seasons, would be a good riddance for you. There is much less risk in dairy land than corn land.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr. Poyser was leaning forward, with his elbows on his knees, his head on one side, and his mouth screwed up\u2014apparently absorbed in making the tips of his fingers meet so as to represent with perfect accuracy the ribs of a ship. He was much too acute a man not to see through the whole business, and to foresee perfectly what would be his wife\u2019s view of the subject; but he disliked giving unpleasant answers. Unless it was on a point of farming practice, he would rather give up than have a quarrel, any day; and, after all, it mattered more to his wife than to him.

If we\u2019re to go to ruin, it shanna be wi\u2019 having our back kitchen turned into a public.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, Poyser,\u201d said the squire, shifting his tactics and looking as if he thought Mrs. Poyser had suddenly withdrawn from the proceedings and left the room, \u201cyou can turn the Hollows into feeding-land. I can easily make another arrangement about supplying my house. And I shall not forget your readiness to accommodate your landlord as well as a neighbour. I know you will be glad to have your lease renewed for three years, when the present one expires; otherwise, I daresay Thurle, who is a man of some capital, would be glad to take both the farms, as they could be worked so well together. But I don\u2019t want to part with an old tenant like you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  To be thrust out of the discussion in this way would have been enough to complete Mrs. Poyser\u2019s exasperation, even without the final threat. Her husband, really alarmed at the possibility of their leaving the old place where he had been bred and born\u2014for he believed the old squire had small spite enough for anything\u2014was beginning a mild remonstrance explanatory of the inconvenience he should find in having to buy and sell more stock, with, \u201cWell, sir, I think as it\u2019s rether hard...\u201d when Mrs. Poyser burst in with the desperate determination to have her say out this once, though it were to rain notices to quit and the only shelter were the work-house. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThen, sir, if I may speak\u2014as, for all I\u2019m a woman, and there\u2019s folks as thinks a woman\u2019s fool enough to stan\u2019 by an\u2019 look on while the men sign her soul away, I\u2019ve a right to speak, for I make one quarter o\u2019 the rent, and save another quarter\u2014I say, if Mr. Thurle\u2019s so ready to take farms under you, it\u2019s a pity but what he should take this, and see if he likes to live in a house wi\u2019 all the plagues o\u2019 Egypt in\u2019t\u2014wi\u2019 the cellar full o\u2019 water, and frogs and toads hoppin\u2019 up the steps by dozens\u2014and the floors rotten, and the rats and mice gnawing every bit o\u2019 cheese, and runnin\u2019 over our heads as we lie i\u2019 bed till we expect \u2019em to eat us up alive\u2014as it\u2019s a mercy they hanna eat the children long ago. I should like to see if there\u2019s another tenant besides Poyser as \u2019ud put up wi\u2019 never having a bit o\u2019 repairs done till a place tumbles down\u2014and not then, on\u2019y wi\u2019 begging and praying and having to pay half\u2014and being strung up wi\u2019 the rent as it\u2019s much if he gets enough out o\u2019 the land to pay, for all he\u2019s put his own money into the ground beforehand. See if you\u2019ll get a stranger to lead such a life here as that: a maggot must be born i\u2019 the rotten cheese to like it, I reckon. You may run away from my words, sir,\u201d continued Mrs. Poyser, following the old squire beyond the door\u2014for after the first moments of stunned surprise he had got up, and, waving his hand towards her with a smile, had walked out towards his pony. But it was impossible for him to get away immediately, for John was walking the pony up and down the yard, and was some distance from the causeway when his master beckoned. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou may run away from my words, sir, and you may go spinnin\u2019 underhand ways o\u2019 doing us a mischief, for you\u2019ve got Old Harry to your friend, though nobody else is, but I tell you for once as we\u2019re not dumb creatures to be abused and made money on by them as ha\u2019 got the lash i\u2019 their hands, for want o\u2019 knowing how t\u2019 undo the tackle. An\u2019 if I\u2019m th\u2019 only one as speaks my mind, there\u2019s plenty o\u2019 the same way o\u2019 thinking i\u2019 this parish and the next to \u2019t, for your name\u2019s no better than a brimstone match in everybody\u2019s nose\u2014if it isna two-three old folks as you think o\u2019 saving your soul by giving \u2019em a bit o\u2019 flannel and a drop o\u2019 porridge. An\u2019 you may be right i\u2019 thinking it\u2019ll take but little to save your soul, for it\u2019ll be the smallest savin\u2019 y\u2019 iver made, wi\u2019 all your scrapin\u2019.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There are occasions on which two servant-girls and a waggoner may be a formidable audience, and as the squire rode away on his black pony, even the gift of short-sightedness did not prevent him from being aware that Molly and Nancy and Tim were grinning not far from him. Perhaps he suspected that sour old John was grinning behind him\u2014which was also the fact. Meanwhile the bull-dog, the black-and-tan terrier, Alick\u2019s sheep-dog, and the gander hissing at a safe distance from the pony\u2019s heels carried out the idea of Mrs. Poyser\u2019s solo in an impressive quartet. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs. Poyser, however, had no sooner seen the pony move off than she turned round, gave the two hilarious damsels a look which drove them into the back kitchen, and unspearing her knitting, began to knit again with her usual rapidity as she re-entered the house.

There\u2019s no pleasure i\u2019 living if you\u2019re to be corked up for ever, and only dribble your mind out by the sly, like a leaky barrel. I shan\u2019t repent saying what I think, if I live to be as old as th\u2019 old squire; and there\u2019s little likelihood\u2014for it seems as if them as aren\u2019t wanted here are th\u2019 only folks as aren\u2019t wanted i\u2019 th\u2019 other world.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut thee wutna like moving from th\u2019 old place, this Michaelmas twelvemonth,\u201d said Mr. Poyser, \u201cand going into a strange parish, where thee know\u2019st nobody.

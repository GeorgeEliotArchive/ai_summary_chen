Ah! I think I taste that whey now\u2014with a flavour so delicate that one can hardly distinguish it from an odour, and with that soft gliding warmth that fills one\u2019s imagination with a still, happy dreaminess. And the light music of the dropping whey is in my ears, mingling with the twittering of a bird outside the wire network window\u2014the window overlooking the garden, and shaded by tall Guelder roses. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHave a little more, Mr. Bede?\u201d said Mrs. Poyser, as Adam set down the basin. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, thank you; I\u2019ll go into the garden now, and send in the little lass.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAye, do; and tell her to come to her mother in the dairy.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam walked round by the rick-yard, at present empty of ricks, to the little wooden gate leading into the garden\u2014once the well-tended kitchen-garden of a manor-house; now, but for the handsome brick wall with stone coping that ran along one side of it, a true farmhouse garden, with hardy perennial flowers, unpruned fruit-trees, and kitchen vegetables growing together in careless, half-neglected abundance. In that leafy, flowery, bushy time, to look for any one in this garden was like playing at \u201chide-and-seek.\u201d There were the tall hollyhocks beginning to flower and dazzle the eye with their pink, white, and yellow; there were the syringas and Guelder roses, all large and disorderly for want of trimming; there were leafy walls of scarlet beans and late peas; there was a row of bushy filberts in one direction, and in another a huge apple-tree making a barren circle under its low-spreading boughs. But what signified a barren patch or two? The garden was so large. There was always a superfluity of broad beans\u2014it took nine or ten of Adam\u2019s strides to get to the end of the uncut grass walk that ran by the side of them; and as for other vegetables, there was so much more room than was necessary for them that in the rotation of crops a large flourishing bed of groundsel was of yearly occurrence on one spot or other. The very rose-trees at which Adam stopped to pluck one looked as if they grew wild; they were all huddled together in bushy masses, now flaunting with wide-open petals, almost all of them of the streaked pink-and-white kind, which doubtless dated from the union of the houses of York and Lancaster. Adam was wise enough to choose a compact Provence rose that peeped out half-smothered by its flaunting scentless neighbours, and held it in his hand\u2014he thought he should be more at ease holding something in his hand\u2014as he walked on to the far end of the garden, where he remembered there was the largest row of currant-trees, not far off from the great yew-tree arbour. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But he had not gone many steps beyond the roses, when he heard the shaking of a bough, and a boy\u2019s voice saying, \u201cNow, then, Totty, hold out your pinny\u2014there\u2019s a duck.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The voice came from the boughs of a tall cherry-tree, where Adam had no difficulty in discerning a small blue-pinafored figure perched in a commodious position where the fruit was thickest. Doubtless Totty was below, behind the screen of peas. Yes\u2014with her bonnet hanging down her back, and her fat face, dreadfully smeared with red juice, turned up towards the cherry-tree, while she held her little round hole of a mouth and her red-stained pinafore to receive the promised downfall. I am sorry to say, more than half the cherries that fell were hard and yellow instead of juicy and red; but Totty spent no time in useless regrets, and she was already sucking the third juiciest when Adam said, \u201cThere now, Totty, you\u2019ve got your cherries. Run into the house with \u2019em to Mother\u2014she wants you\u2014she\u2019s in the dairy. Run in this minute\u2014there\u2019s a good little girl.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He lifted her up in his strong arms and kissed her as he spoke, a ceremony which Totty regarded as a tiresome interruption to cherry-eating; and when he set her down she trotted off quite silently towards the house, sucking her cherries as she went along. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTommy, my lad, take care you\u2019re not shot for a little thieving bird,\u201d said Adam, as he walked on towards the currant-trees. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He could see there was a large basket at the end of the row: Hetty would not be far off, and Adam already felt as if she were looking at him. Yet when he turned the corner she was standing with her back towards him, and stooping to gather the low-hanging fruit. Strange that she had not heard him coming! Perhaps it was because she was making the leaves rustle. She started when she became conscious that some one was near\u2014started so violently that she dropped the basin with the currants in it, and then, when she saw it was Adam, she turned from pale to deep red. That blush made his heart beat with a new happiness. Hetty had never blushed at seeing him before. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI frightened you,\u201d he said, with a delicious sense that it didn\u2019t signify what he said, since Hetty seemed to feel as much as he did; \u201clet ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"me")," pick the currants up.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  That was soon done, for they had only fallen in a tangled mass on the grass-plot, and Adam, as he rose and gave her the basin again, looked straight into her eyes with the subdued tenderness that belongs to the first moments of hopeful love. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty did not turn away her eyes; her blush had subsided, and she met his glance with a quiet sadness, which contented Adam because it was so unlike anything he had seen in her before. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere\u2019s not many more currants to get,\u201d she said; \u201cI shall soon ha\u2019 done now.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d said Adam; and he fetched the large basket, which was nearly full of currants, and set it close to them. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Not a word more was spoken as they gathered the currants. Adam\u2019s heart was too full to speak, and he thought Hetty knew all that was in it. She was not indifferent to his presence after all; she had blushed when she saw him, and then there was that touch of sadness about her which must surely mean love, since it was the opposite of her usual manner, which had often impressed him as indifference. And he could glance at her continually as she bent over the fruit, while the level evening sunbeams stole through the thick apple-tree boughs, and rested on her round cheek and neck as if they too were in love with her. It was to Adam the time that a man can least forget in after-life, the time when he believes that the first woman he has ever loved betrays by a slight something\u2014a word, a tone, a glance, the quivering of a lip or an eyelid\u2014that she is at least beginning to love him in return. The sign is so slight, it is scarcely perceptible to the ear or eye\u2014he could describe it to no one\u2014it is a mere feather-touch, yet it seems to have changed his whole being, to have merged an uneasy yearning into a delicious unconsciousness of everything but the present moment. So much of our early gladness vanishes utterly from our memory: we can never recall the joy with which we laid our heads on our mother\u2019s bosom or rode on our father\u2019s back in childhood. Doubtless that joy is wrought up into our nature, as the sunlight of long-past mornings is wrought up in the soft mellowness of the apricot, but it is gone for ever from our imagination, and we can only ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"believe")," in the joy of childhood. But the first glad moment in our first love is a vision which returns to us to the last, and brings with it a thrill of feeling intense and special as the recurrent sensation of a sweet odour breathed in a far-off hour of happiness. It is a memory that gives a more exquisite touch to tenderness, that feeds the madness of jealousy and adds the last keenness to the agony of despair. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty bending over the red bunches, the level rays piercing the screen of apple-tree boughs, the length of bushy garden beyond, his own emotion as he looked at her and believed that she was thinking of him, and that there was no need for them to talk\u2014Adam remembered it all to the last moment of his life. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  And Hetty? You know quite well that Adam was mistaken about her. Like many other men, he thought the signs of love for another were signs of love towards himself. When Adam was approaching unseen by her, she was absorbed as usual in thinking and wondering about Arthur\u2019s possible return. The sound of any man\u2019s footstep would have affected her just in the same way\u2014she would have ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"felt")," it might be Arthur before she had time to see, and the blood that forsook her cheek in the agitation of that momentary feeling would have rushed back again at the sight of any one else just as much as at the sight of Adam. He was not wrong in thinking that a change had come over Hetty: the anxieties and fears of a first passion, with which she was trembling, had become stronger than vanity, had given her for the first time that sense of helpless dependence on another\u2019s feeling which awakens the clinging deprecating womanhood even in the shallowest girl that can ever experience it, and creates in her a sensibility to kindness which found her quite hard before. For the first time Hetty felt that there was something soothing to her in Adam\u2019s timid yet manly tenderness. She wanted to be treated lovingly\u2014oh, it was very hard to bear this blank of absence, silence, apparent indifference, after those moments of glowing love! She was not afraid that Adam would tease her with love-making and flattering speeches like her other admirers; he had always been so reserved to her; she could enjoy without any fear the sense that this strong brave man loved her and was near her. It never entered into her mind that Adam was pitiable too\u2014that Adam too must suffer one day. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty, we know, was not the first woman that had behaved more gently to the man who loved her in vain because she had herself begun to love another. It was a very old story, but Adam knew nothing about it, so he drank in the sweet delusion. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThat\u2019ll do,\u201d said Hetty, after a little while. \u201cAunt wants me to leave some on the trees.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, I used to watch \u2019em often when I was a lad. But now, you see, I can carry the basket with one arm, as if it was an empty nutshell, and give you th\u2019 other arm to lean on. Won\u2019t you? Such big arms as mine were made for little arms like yours to lean on.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty smiled faintly and put her arm within his. Adam looked down at her, but her eyes were turned dreamily towards another corner of the garden. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHave you ever been to Eagledale?\u201d she said, as they walked slowly along. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Adam, pleased to have her ask a question about himself. \u201cTen years ago, when I was a lad, I went with father to see about some work there. It\u2019s a wonderful sight\u2014rocks and caves such as you never saw in your life. I never had a right notion o\u2019 rocks till I went there.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHow long did it take to get there?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, it took us the best part o\u2019 two days\u2019 walking. But it\u2019s nothing of a day\u2019s journey for anybody as has got a first-rate nag. The captain \u2019ud get there in nine or ten hours, I\u2019ll be bound, he\u2019s such a rider. And I shouldn\u2019t wonder if he\u2019s back again to-morrow; he\u2019s too active to rest long in that lonely place, all by himself, for there\u2019s nothing but a bit of a inn i\u2019 that part where he\u2019s gone to fish. I wish he\u2019d got th\u2019 estate in his hands; that \u2019ud be the right thing for him, for it \u2019ud give him plenty to do, and he\u2019d do\u2019t well too, for all he\u2019s so young; he\u2019s got better notions o\u2019 things than many a man twice his age. He spoke very handsome to me th\u2019 other day about lending me money to set up i\u2019 business; and if things came round that way, I\u2019d rather be beholding to him nor to any man i\u2019 the world.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Poor Adam was led on to speak about Arthur because he thought Hetty would be pleased to know that the young squire was so ready to befriend him; the fact entered into his future prospects, which he would like to seem promising in her eyes. And it was true that Hetty listened with an interest which brought a new light into her eyes and a half-smile upon her lips. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHow pretty the roses are now!\u201d Adam continued, pausing to look at them. \u201cSee! I stole the prettiest, but I didna mean to keep it myself.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt smells very sweet,\u201d he said; \u201cthose striped uns have no smell. Stick it in your frock, and then you can put it in water after. It \u2019ud be a pity to let it fade.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty took the rose, smiling as she did so at the pleasant thought that Arthur could so soon get back if he liked. There was a flash of hope and happiness in her mind, and with a sudden impulse of gaiety she did what she had very often done before\u2014stuck the rose in her hair a little above the left ear. The tender admiration in Adam\u2019s face was slightly shadowed by reluctant disapproval. Hetty\u2019s love of finery was just the thing that would most provoke his mother, and he himself disliked it as much as it was possible for him to dislike anything that belonged to her. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s like the ladies in the pictures at the Chase; they\u2019ve mostly got flowers or feathers or gold things i\u2019 their hair, but somehow I don\u2019t like to see \u2019em; they allays put me i\u2019 mind o\u2019 the painted women outside the shows at Treddles\u2019on Fair. What can a woman have to set her off better than her own hair, when it curls so, like yours? If a woman\u2019s young and pretty, I think you can see her good looks all the better for her being plain dressed. Why, Dinah Morris looks very nice, for all she wears such a plain cap and gown. It seems to me as a woman\u2019s face doesna want flowers; it\u2019s almost like a flower itself. I\u2019m sure yours is.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, very well,\u201d said Hetty, with a little playful pout, taking the rose out of her hair. \u201cI\u2019ll put one o\u2019 Dinah\u2019s caps on when we go in, and you\u2019ll see if I look better in it. She left one behind, so I can take the pattern.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNay, nay, I don\u2019t want you to wear a Methodist cap like Dinah\u2019s. I daresay it\u2019s a very ugly cap, and I used to think when I saw her here as it was nonsense for her to dress different t\u2019 other people; but I never rightly noticed her till she came to see mother last week, and then I thought the cap seemed to fit her face somehow as th \u2018acorn-cup fits th\u2019 acorn, and I shouldn\u2019t like to see her so well without it. But you\u2019ve got another sort o\u2019 face; I\u2019d have you just as you are now, without anything t\u2019 interfere with your own looks. It\u2019s like when a man\u2019s singing a good tune\u2014you don\u2019t want t\u2019 hear bells tinkling and interfering wi\u2019 the sound.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  He took her arm and put it within his again, looking down on her fondly. He was afraid she should think he had lectured her, imagining, as we are apt to do, that she had perceived all the thoughts he had only half-expressed. And the thing he dreaded most was lest any cloud should come over this evening\u2019s happiness. For the world he would not have spoken of his love to Hetty yet, till this commencing kindness towards him should have grown into unmistakable love. In his imagination he saw long years of his future life stretching before him, blest with the right to call Hetty his own: he could be content with very little at present. So he took up the basket of currants once more, and they went on towards the house. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The scene had quite changed in the half-hour that Adam had been in the garden. The yard was full of life now: Marty was letting the screaming geese through the gate, and wickedly provoking the gander by hissing at him; the granary-door was groaning on its hinges as Alick shut it, after dealing out the corn; the horses were being led out to watering, amidst much barking of all the three dogs and many \u201cwhups\u201d from Tim the ploughman, as if the heavy animals who held down their meek, intelligent heads, and lifted their shaggy feet so deliberately, were likely to rush wildly in every direction but the right. Everybody was come back from the meadow; and when Hetty and Adam entered the house-place, Mr. Poyser was seated in the three-cornered chair, and the grandfather in the large arm-chair opposite, looking on with pleasant expectation while the supper was being laid on the oak table. Mrs. Poyser had laid the cloth herself\u2014a cloth made of homespun linen, with a shining checkered pattern on it, and of an agreeable whitey-brown hue, such as all sensible housewives like to see\u2014none of your bleached \u201cshop-rag\u201d that would wear into holes in no time, but good homespun that would last for two generations. The cold veal, the fresh lettuces, and the stuffed chine might well look tempting to hungry men who had dined at half-past twelve o\u2019clock. On the large deal table against the wall there were bright pewter plates and spoons and cans, ready for Alick and his companions; for the master and servants ate their supper not far off each other; which was all the pleasanter, because if a remark about to-morrow morning\u2019s work occurred to Mr. Poyser, Alick was at hand to hear it. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWell, Adam, I\u2019m glad to see ye,\u201d said Mr. Poyser. \u201cWhat! ye\u2019ve been helping Hetty to gether the curran\u2019s, eh? Come, sit ye down, sit ye down. Why, it\u2019s pretty near a three-week since y\u2019 had your supper with us; and the missis has got one of her rare stuffed chines. I\u2019m glad ye\u2019re come.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHetty,\u201d said Mrs. Poyser, as she looked into the basket of currants to see if the fruit was fine, \u201crun upstairs and send Molly down. She\u2019s putting Totty to bed, and I want her to draw th\u2019 ale, for Nancy\u2019s busy yet i\u2019 the dairy. You can see to the child. But whativer did you let her run away from you along wi\u2019 Tommy for, and stuff herself wi\u2019 fruit as she can\u2019t eat a bit o\u2019 good victual?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  This was said in a lower tone than usual, while her husband was talking to Adam; for Mrs. Poyser was strict in adherence to her own rules of propriety, and she considered that a young girl was not to be treated sharply in the presence of a respectable man who was courting her. That would not be fair-play: every woman was young in her turn, and had her chances of matrimony, which it was a point of honour for other women not to spoil\u2014just as one market-woman who has sold her own eggs must not try to balk another of a customer. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty made haste to run away upstairs, not easily finding an answer to her aunt\u2019s question, and Mrs. Poyser went out to see after Marty and Tommy and bring them in to supper. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Soon they were all seated\u2014the two rosy lads, one on each side, by the pale mother, a place being left for Hetty between Adam and her uncle. Alick too was come in, and was seated in his far corner, eating cold broad beans out of a large dish with his pocket-knife, and finding a flavour in them which he would not have exchanged for the finest pineapple. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat a time that gell is drawing th\u2019 ale, to be sure!\u201d said Mrs. Poyser, when she was dispensing her slices of stuffed chine. \u201cI think she sets the jug under and forgets to turn the tap, as there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t believe o\u2019 them wenches: they\u2019ll set the empty kettle o\u2019 the fire, and then come an hour after to see if the water boils.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cShe\u2019s drawin\u2019 for the men too,\u201d said Mr. Poyser. \u201cThee shouldst ha\u2019 told her to bring our jug up first.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cTold her?\u201d said Mrs. Poyser. \u201cYes, I might spend all the wind i\u2019 my body, an\u2019 take the bellows too, if I was to tell them gells everything as their own sharpness wonna tell \u2019em. Mr. Bede, will you take some vinegar with your lettuce? Aye you\u2019re i\u2019 the right not. It spoils the flavour o\u2019 the chine, to my thinking. It\u2019s poor eating where the flavour o\u2019 the meat lies i\u2019 the cruets. There\u2019s folks as make bad butter and trusten to the salt t\u2019 hide it.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs. Poyser\u2019s attention was here diverted by the appearance of Molly, carrying a large jug, two small mugs, and four drinking-cans, all full of ale or small beer\u2014an interesting example of the prehensile power possessed by the human hand. Poor Molly\u2019s mouth was rather wider open than usual, as she walked along with her eyes fixed on the double cluster of vessels in her hands, quite innocent of the expression in her mistress\u2019s eye. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMolly, I niver knew your equils\u2014to think o\u2019 your poor mother as is a widow, an\u2019 I took you wi\u2019 as good as no character, an\u2019 the times an\u2019 times I\u2019ve told you....\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Molly had not seen the lightning, and the thunder shook her nerves the more for the want of that preparation. With a vague alarmed sense that she must somehow comport herself differently, she hastened her step a little towards the far deal table, where she might set down her cans\u2014caught her foot in her apron, which had become untied, and fell with a crash and a splash into a pool of beer; whereupon a tittering explosion from Marty and Tommy, and a serious \u201cEllo!\u201d from Mr. Poyser, who saw his draught of ale unpleasantly deferred. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThere you go!\u201d resumed Mrs. Poyser, in a cutting tone, as she rose and went towards the cupboard while Molly began dolefully to pick up the fragments of pottery. \u201cIt\u2019s what I told you \u2019ud come, over and over again; and there\u2019s your month\u2019s wage gone, and more, to pay for that jug as I\u2019ve had i\u2019 the house this ten year, and nothing ever happened to\u2019t before; but the crockery you\u2019ve broke sin\u2019 here in th\u2019 house you\u2019ve been \u2019ud make a parson swear\u2014God forgi\u2019 me for saying so\u2014an\u2019 if it had been boiling wort out o\u2019 the copper, it \u2019ud ha\u2019 been the same, and you\u2019d ha\u2019 been scalded and very like lamed for life, as there\u2019s no knowing but what you will be some day if you go on; for anybody \u2019ud think you\u2019d got the St. Vitus\u2019s Dance, to see the things you\u2019ve throwed down.

But wooden folks had need ha\u2019 wooden things t\u2019 handle. And here must I take the brown-and-white jug, as it\u2019s niver been used three times this year, and go down i\u2019 the cellar myself, and belike catch my death, and be laid up wi\u2019 inflammation....\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mrs. Poyser had turned round from the cupboard with the brown-and-white jug in her hand, when she caught sight of something at the other end of the kitchen; perhaps it was because she was already trembling and nervous that the apparition had so strong an effect on her; perhaps jug-breaking, like other crimes, has a contagious influence. However it was, she stared and started like a ghost-seer, and the precious brown-and-white jug fell to the ground, parting for ever with its spout and handle. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cDid ever anybody see the like?\u201d she said, with a suddenly lowered tone, after a moment\u2019s bewildered glance round the room. \u201cThe jugs are bewitched, ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I")," think.

The little minx had found a black gown of her aunt\u2019s, and pinned it close round her neck to look like Dinah\u2019s, had made her hair as flat as she could, and had tied on one of Dinah\u2019s high-crowned borderless net caps. The thought of Dinah\u2019s pale grave face and mild grey eyes, which the sight of the gown and cap brought with it, made it a laughable surprise enough to see them replaced by Hetty\u2019s round rosy cheeks and coquettish dark eyes. The boys got off their chairs and jumped round her, clapping their hands, and even Alick gave a low ventral laugh as he looked up from his beans. Under cover of the noise, Mrs. Poyser went into the back kitchen to send Nancy into the cellar with the great pewter measure, which had some chance of being free from bewitchment. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, Hetty, lass, are ye turned Methodist?\u201d said Mr. Poyser, with that comfortable slow enjoyment of a laugh which one only sees in stout people. \u201cYou must pull your face a deal longer before you\u2019ll do for one; mustna she, Adam?

Tommy, who was of a susceptible disposition, and very fond of his mother, and who had, besides, eaten so many cherries as to have his feelings less under command than usual, was so affected by the dreadful picture she had made of the possible future that he began to cry; and the good-natured father, indulgent to all weaknesses but those of negligent farmers, said to Hetty, \u201cYou\u2019d better take the things off again, my lass; it hurts your aunt to see \u2019em.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty went upstairs again, and the arrival of the ale made an agreeable diversion; for Adam had to give his opinion of the new tap, which could not be otherwise than complimentary to Mrs. Poyser; and then followed a discussion on the secrets of good brewing, the folly of stinginess in \u201chopping,\u201d and the doubtful economy of a farmer\u2019s making his own malt. Mrs. Poyser had so many opportunities of expressing herself with weight on these subjects that by the time supper was ended, the ale-jug refilled, and Mr. Poyser\u2019s pipe alight she was once more in high good humour, and ready, at Adam\u2019s request, to fetch the broken spinning-wheel for his inspection.

I look for me and Seth to get a little business for ourselves i\u2019 that way, for I know a man at Rosseter as \u2019ull take as many things as we should make, besides what we could get orders for round about.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Mr. Poyser entered with interest into a project which seemed a step towards Adam\u2019s becoming a \u201cmaster-man,\u201d and Mrs. Poyser gave her approbation to the scheme of the movable kitchen cupboard, which was to be capable of containing grocery, pickles, crockery, and house-linen in the utmost compactness without confusion. Hetty, once more in her own dress, with her neckerchief pushed a little backwards on this warm evening, was seated picking currants near the window, where Adam could see her quite well. And so the time passed pleasantly till Adam got up to go. He was pressed to come again soon, but not to stay longer, for at this busy time sensible people would not run the risk of being sleepy at five o\u2019clock in the morning. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI shall take a step farther,\u201d said Adam, \u201cand go on to see Mester Massey, for he wasn\u2019t at church yesterday, and I\u2019ve not seen him for a week past. I\u2019ve never hardly known him to miss church before.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAye,\u201d said Mr. Poyser, \u201cwe\u2019ve heared nothing about him, for it\u2019s the boys\u2019 hollodays now, so we can give you no account.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut you\u2019ll niver think o\u2019 going there at this hour o\u2019 the night?\u201d said Mrs. Poyser, folding up her knitting. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, Mester Massey sits up late,\u201d said Adam. \u201cAn\u2019 the night-school\u2019s not over yet. Some o\u2019 the men don\u2019t come till late\u2014they\u2019ve got so far to walk.

Good-night, Mrs. Poyser; good-night, Hetty.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty could only smile and not shake hands, for hers were dyed and damp with currant-juice; but all the rest gave a hearty shake to the large palm that was held out to them, and said, \u201cCome again, come again!\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAye, think o\u2019 that now,\u201d said Mr. Poyser, when Adam was out of on the causeway. \u201cSitting up till past twelve to do extry work! Ye\u2019ll not find many men o\u2019 six-an\u2019 twenty as \u2019ull do to put i\u2019 the shafts wi\u2019 him.

To ride in a spring-cart seemed a very miserable lot indeed to her now."))}y.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

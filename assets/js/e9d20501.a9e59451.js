They, too, like Hetty, had lingered a little in their walk, for Dinah was trying to speak words of comfort and strength to Seth in these parting moments. But when they saw Hetty, they paused and shook hands; Seth turned homewards, and Dinah came on alone. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cSeth Bede would have come and spoken to you, my dear,\u201d she said, as she reached Hetty, \u201cbut he\u2019s very full of trouble to-night.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Hetty answered with a dimpled smile, as if she did not quite know what had been said; and it made a strange contrast to see that sparkling self-engrossed loveliness looked at by Dinah\u2019s calm pitying face, with its open glance which told that her heart lived in no cherished secrets of its own, but in feelings which it longed to share with all the world. Hetty liked Dinah as well as she had ever liked any woman; how was it possible to feel otherwise towards one who always put in a kind word for her when her aunt was finding fault, and who was always ready to take Totty off her hands\u2014little tiresome Totty, that was made such a pet of by every one, and that Hetty could see no interest in at all? Dinah had never said anything disapproving or reproachful to Hetty during her whole visit to the Hall Farm; she had talked to her a great deal in a serious way, but Hetty didn\u2019t mind that much, for she never listened: whatever Dinah might say, she almost always stroked Hetty\u2019s cheek after it, and wanted to do some mending for her. Dinah was a riddle to her; Hetty looked at her much in the same way as one might imagine a little perching bird that could only flutter from bough to bough, to look at the swoop of the swallow or the mounting of the lark; but she did not care to solve such riddles, any more than she cared to know what was meant by the pictures in the Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, or in the old folio Bible that Marty and Tommy always plagued her about on a Sunday.

It\u2019s a strange thing\u2014sometimes when I\u2019m quite alone, sitting in my room with my eyes closed, or walking over the hills, the people I\u2019ve seen and known, if it\u2019s only been for a few days, are brought before me, and I hear their voices and see them look and move almost plainer than I ever did when they were really with me so as I could touch them. And then my heart is drawn out towards them, and I feel their lot as if it was my own, and I take comfort in spreading it before the Lord and resting in His love, on their behalf as well as my own.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cIt has been a very precious time to me,\u201d Dinah went on, \u201clast night and to-day\u2014seeing two such good sons as Adam and Seth Bede. They are so tender and thoughtful for their aged mother. And she has been telling me what Adam has done, for these many years, to help his father and his brother; it\u2019s wonderful what a spirit of wisdom and knowledge he has, and how he\u2019s ready to use it all in behalf of them that are feeble. And I\u2019m sure he has a loving spirit too. I\u2019ve noticed it often among my own people round Snowfield, that the strong, skilful men are often the gentlest to the women and children; and it\u2019s pretty to see \u2019em carrying the little babies as if they were no heavier than little birds. And the babies always seem to like the strong arm best. I feel sure it would be so with Adam Bede. Don\u2019t you think so, Hetty?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes,\u201d said Hetty abstractedly, for her mind had been all the while in the wood, and she would have found it difficult to say what she was assenting to. Dinah saw she was not inclined to talk, but there would not have been time to say much more, for they were now at the yard-gate. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The still twilight, with its dying western red and its few faint struggling stars, rested on the farm-yard, where there was not a sound to be heard but the stamping of the cart-horses in the stable. It was about twenty minutes after sunset. The fowls were all gone to roost, and the bull-dog lay stretched on the straw outside his kennel, with the black-and-tan terrier by his side, when the falling-to of the gate disturbed them and set them barking, like good officials, before they had any distinct knowledge of the reason. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  The barking had its effect in the house, for, as Dinah and Hetty approached, the doorway was filled by a portly figure, with a ruddy black-eyed face which bore in it the possibility of looking extremely acute, and occasionally contemptuous, on market-days, but had now a predominant after-supper expression of hearty good-nature. It is well known that great scholars who have shown the most pitiless acerbity in their criticism of other men\u2019s scholarship have yet been of a relenting and indulgent temper in private life; and I have heard of a learned man meekly rocking the twins in the cradle with his left hand, while with his right he inflicted the most lacerating sarcasms on an opponent who had betrayed a brutal ignorance of Hebrew. Weaknesses and errors must be forgiven\u2014alas! they are not alien to us\u2014but the man who takes the wrong side on the momentous subject of the Hebrew points must be treated as the enemy of his race. There was the same sort of antithetic mixture in Martin Poyser: he was of so excellent a disposition that he had been kinder and more respectful than ever to his old father since he had made a deed of gift of all his property, and no man judged his neighbours more charitably on all personal matters; but for a farmer, like Luke Britton, for example, whose fallows were not well cleaned, who didn\u2019t know the rudiments of hedging and ditching, and showed but a small share of judgment in the purchase of winter stock, Martin Poyser was as hard and implacable as the north-east wind. Luke Britton could not make a remark, even on the weather, but Martin Poyser detected in it a taint of that unsoundness and general ignorance which was palpable in all his farming operations. He hated to see the fellow lift the pewter pint to his mouth in the bar of the Royal George on market-day, and the mere sight of him on the other side of the road brought a severe and critical expression into his black eyes, as different as possible from the fatherly glance he bent on his two nieces as they approached the door. Mr. Poyser had smoked his evening pipe, and now held his hands in his pockets, as the only resource of a man who continues to sit up after the day\u2019s business is done. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhy, lasses, ye\u2019re rather late to-night,\u201d he said, when they reached the little gate leading into the causeway. \u201cThe mother\u2019s begun to fidget about you, an\u2019 she\u2019s got the little un ill.

He\u2019s not one o\u2019 them as is all straw and no grain. I\u2019ll be bond for him any day, as he\u2019ll be a good son to the last. Did he say he\u2019d be coming to see us soon?

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  In the large wicker-bottomed arm-chair in the left-hand chimney-nook sat old Martin Poyser, a hale but shrunken and bleached image of his portly black-haired son\u2014his head hanging forward a little, and his elbows pushed backwards so as to allow the whole of his forearm to rest on the arm of the chair. His blue handkerchief was spread over his knees, as was usual indoors, when it was not hanging over his head; and he sat watching what went forward with the quiet ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"outward")," glance of healthy old age, which, disengaged from any interest in an inward drama, spies out pins upon the floor, follows one\u2019s minutest motions with an unexpectant purposeless tenacity, watches the flickering of the flame or the sun-gleams on the wall, counts the quarries on the floor, watches even the hand of the clock, and pleases itself with detecting a rhythm in the tick.

But here her aunt\u2019s attention was diverted from this tender subject by Totty, who, perceiving at length that the arrival of her cousins was not likely to bring anything satisfactory to her in particular, began to cry, \u201cMunny, munny,\u201d in an explosive manner.

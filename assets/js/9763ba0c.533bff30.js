The famous \u201cdry election\u201d was at hand, in which the depths of public feeling might be measured by the low flood-mark of drink. Will Ladislaw was one of the busiest at this time; and though Dorothea\u2019s widowhood was continually in his thought, he was so far from wishing to be spoken to on the subject, that when Lydgate sought him out to tell him what had passed about the Lowick living, he answered rather waspishly\u2014 "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cWhy should you bring me into the matter?

There were plenty of reasons why he should not go\u2014public reasons why he should not quit his post at this crisis, leaving Mr. Brooke in the lurch when he needed \u201ccoaching\u201d for the election, and when there was so much canvassing, direct and indirect, to be carried on. Will could not like to leave his own chessmen in the heat of a game; and any candidate on the right side, even if his brain and marrow had been as soft as was consistent with a gentlemanly bearing, might help to turn a majority. To coach Mr. Brooke and keep him steadily to the idea that he must pledge himself to vote for the actual Reform Bill, instead of insisting on his independence and power of pulling up in time, was not an easy task.

Mr. Hawley and his party would bend all their forces to the return of Pinkerton, and Mr. Brooke\u2019s success must depend either on plumpers which would leave Bagster in the rear, or on the new minting of Tory votes into reforming votes.

Will stopped his ears. Occasionally Parliament, like the rest of our lives, even to our eating and apparel, could hardly go on if our imaginations were too active about processes.

He had written out various speeches and memoranda for speeches, but he had begun to perceive that Mr. Brooke\u2019s mind, if it had the burthen of remembering any train of thought, would let it drop, run away in search of it, and not easily come back again. To collect documents is one mode of serving your country, and to remember the contents of a document is another. No! the only way in which Mr. Brooke could be coerced into thinking of the right arguments at the right time was to be well plied with them till they took up all the room in his brain.

"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"However, Ladislaw\u2019s coaching was forthwith to be put to the test, for before the day of nomination Mr. Brooke was to explain himself to the worthy electors of Middlemarch from the balcony of the White Hart, which looked out advantageously at an angle of the market-place, commanding a large area in front and two converging streets. It was a fine May morning, and everything seemed hopeful: there was some prospect of an understanding between Bagster\u2019s committee and Brooke\u2019s, to which Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Standish as a Liberal lawyer, and such manufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr. Vincy, gave a solidity which almost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and his associates who sat for Pinkerton at the Green Dragon. Mr. Brooke, conscious of having weakened the blasts of the \u201cTrumpet\u201d against him, by his reforms as a landlord in the last half year, and hearing himself cheered a little as he drove into the town, felt his heart tolerably light under his buff-colored waistcoat.

Meanwhile the crowd became denser, and as the political personage neared the end of his speech, Mr. Brooke felt a remarkable change in his sensations while he still handled his eye-glass, trifled with documents before him, and exchanged remarks with his committee, as a man to whom the moment of summons was indifferent.

Pray pity him: so many English gentlemen make themselves miserable by speechifying on entirely private grounds! whereas Mr. Brooke wished to serve his country by standing for Parliament\u2014which, indeed, may also be done on private grounds, but being once undertaken does absolutely demand some speechifying.

The next moment he saw it dolorously bespattered with eggs. His spirit rose a little, and his voice too. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"\u201cBuffoonery, tricks, ridicule the test of truth\u2014all that is very well\u201d\u2014here an unpleasant egg broke on Mr. Brooke\u2019s shoulder, as the echo said, \u201cAll that is very well;\u201d then came a hail of eggs, chiefly aimed at the image, but occasionally hitting the original, as if by chance. There was a stream of new men pushing among the crowd; whistles, yells, bellowings, and fifes made all the greater hubbub because there was shouting and struggling to put them down. No voice would have had wing enough to rise above the uproar, and Mr. Brooke, disagreeably anointed, stood his ground no longer. The frustration would have been less exasperating if it had been less gamesome and boyish: a serious assault of which the newspaper reporter \u201ccan aver that it endangered the learned gentleman\u2019s ribs,\u201d or can respectfully bear witness to \u201cthe soles of that gentleman\u2019s boots having been visible above the railing,\u201d has perhaps more consolations attached to it.

I should have got the ear of the people by-and-by\u2014but they didn\u2019t give me time. I should have gone into the Bill by-and-by, you know,\u201d he added, glancing at Ladislaw. \u201cHowever, things will come all right at the nomination.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"But it was not resolved unanimously that things would come right; on the contrary, the committee looked rather grim, and the political personage from Brassing was writing busily, as if he were brewing new devices.

Why should he stay? If the impassable gulf between himself and Dorothea were ever to be filled up, it must rather be by his going away and getting into a thoroughly different position than by staying here and slipping into deserved contempt as an understrapper of Brooke\u2019s. Then came the young dream of wonders that he might do\u2014in five years, for example: political writing, political speaking, would get a higher value now public life was going to be wider and more national, and they might give him such distinction that he would not seem to be asking Dorothea to step down to him. Five years:\u2014if he could only be sure that she cared for him more than for others; if he could only make her aware that he stood aloof until he could tell his love without lowering himself\u2014then he could go away easily, and begin a career which at five-and-twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of things, where talent brings fame, and fame everything else which is delightful. He could speak and he could write; he could master any subject if he chose, and he meant always to take the side of reason and justice, on which he would carry all his ardor. Why should he not one day be lifted above the shoulders of the crowd, and feel that he had won that eminence well? Without doubt he would leave Middlemarch, go to town, and make himself fit for celebrity by \u201ceating his dinners.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"But not immediately: not until some kind of sign had passed between him and Dorothea.

Deputations without and voices within had concurred in inducing that philanthropist to take a stronger measure than usual for the good of mankind; namely, to withdraw in favor of another candidate, to whom he left the advantages of his canvassing machinery. He himself called this a strong measure, but observed that his health was less capable of sustaining excitement than he had imagined.

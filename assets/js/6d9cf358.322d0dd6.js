"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"\u2018It\u2019s a devil of a position this for a man to be in,\u2019 was the train of his thought, as he kept his eyes fixed on the glass, while he leaned back in his chair, and crossed his hands behind his head; \u2018between two jealous women, and both of them as ready to take fire as tinder. And in my state of health, too! I should be glad enough to run away from the whole affair, and go off to some lotos-eating place or other where there are no women, or only women who are too sleepy to be jealous. Here am I, doing nothing to please myself, trying to do the best thing for everybody else, and all the comfort I get is to have fire shot at me from women\u2019s eyes, and venom spirted at me from women\u2019s tongues. If Beatrice takes another jealous fit into her head--and it\u2019s likely enough, Tina is so unmanageable--I don\u2019t know what storm she may raise. And any hitch in this marriage, especially of that sort, might be a fatal business for the old gentleman. I wouldn\u2019t have such a blow fall upon him for a great deal. Besides, a man must be married some time in his life, and I could hardly do better than marry Beatrice. She\u2019s an uncommonly fine woman, and I\u2019m really very fond of her; and as I shall let her have her own way, her temper won\u2019t signify much. I wish the wedding was over and done with, for this fuss doesn\u2019t suit me at all. I haven\u2019t been half so well lately. That scene about Tina this morning quite upset me. Poor little Tina! What a little simpleton it was, to set her heart on me in that way! But she ought to see how impossible it is that things should be different. If she would but understand how kindly I feel towards her, and make up her mind to look on me as a friend;--but that is what one never can get a woman to do. Beatrice is very good-natured; I\u2019m sure she would be kind to the little thing. It would be a great comfort if Tina would take to Gilfil, if it were only in anger against me. He\u2019d make her a capital husband, and I should like to see the little grass-hopper happy. If I had been in a different position, I would certainly have married her myself: hut that was out of the question with my responsibilities to Sir Christopher. I think a little persuasion from my uncle would bring her to accept Gilfil; I know she would never be able to oppose my uncle\u2019s wishes. And if they were once married, she\u2019s such a loving little thing, she would soon be billing and cooing with him as if she had never known me. It would certainly be the best thing for her happiness if that marriage were hastened. Heigho! Those are lucky fellows that have no women falling in love with them. It\u2019s a confounded responsibility.\u2019 "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"At this point in his meditations he turned his head a little, so as to get a three-quarter view of his face.

All earthly things have their lull: even on nights when the most unappeasable wind is raging, there will be a moment of stillness before it crashes among the boughs again, and storms against the windows, and howls like a thousand lost demons through the keyholes. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Miss Assher appeared to be in the highest good-humour; Captain Wybrow was more assiduous than usual, and was very circumspect in his behaviour to Caterina, on whom Miss Assher bestowed unwonted attentions. The weather was brilliant; there were riding excursions in the mornings and dinner-parties in the evenings. Consultations in the library between Sir Christopher and Lady Assher seemed to be leading to a satisfactory result; and it was understood that this visit at Cheverel Manor would terminate in another fortnight, when the preparations for the wedding would be carried forward with all despatch at Farleigh. The Baronet seemed every day more radiant. Accustomed to view people who entered into his plans by the pleasant light which his own strong will and bright hopefulness were always casting on the future, he saw nothing hut personal charms and promising domestic qualities in Miss Assher, whose quickness of eye and taste in externals formed a real ground of sympathy between her and Sir Christopher. Lady Cheverel\u2019s enthusiasm never rose above the temperate mark of calm satisfaction, and, having quite her share of the critical acumen which characterizes the mutual estimates of the fair sex, she had a more moderate opinion of Miss Assher\u2019s qualities. She suspected that the fair Beatrice had a sharp and imperious temper; and being herself, on principle and by habitual self-command, the most deferential of wives, she noticed with disapproval Miss Assher\u2019s occasional air of authority towards Captain Wybrow. A proud woman who has learned to submit, carries all her pride to the reinforcement of her submission, and looks down with severe superiority on all feminine assumption as \u2018unbecoming\u2019. Lady Cheverel, however, confined her criticisms to the privacy of her own thoughts, and, with a reticence which I fear may seem incredible, did not use them as a means of disturbing her husband\u2019s complacency.

To her the change in Miss Assher\u2019s manner was unaccountable. Those compassionate attentions, those smiling condescensions, were torture to Caterina, who was constantly tempted to repulse them with anger. She thought, \u2018Perhaps Anthony has told her to be kind to poor Tina.\u2019 This was an insult. He ought to have known that the mere presence of Miss Assher was painful to her, that Miss Assher\u2019s smiles scorched her, that Miss Assher\u2019s kind words were like poison stings inflaming her to madness. And he--Anthony--he was evidently repenting of the tenderness he had been betrayed into that morning in the drawing-room. He was cold and distant and civil to her, to ward off Beatrice\u2019s suspicions, and Beatrice could be so gracious now, because she was sure of Anthony\u2019s entire devotion. Well! and so it ought to be--and she ought not to wish it otherwise. And yet--oh, he ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"was")," cruel to her. She could never have behaved so to him. To make her love him so--to speak such tender words--to give her such caresses, and then to behave as if such things had never been.

There, with loud whispers and sobs, restlessly pacing up and down, lying on the hard floor, courting cold and weariness, she told to the pitiful listening night the anguish which she could pour into no mortal ear. But always sleep came at last, and always in the morning the reactive calm that enabled her to live through the day.

The very delicacy of Caterina\u2019s usual appearance, her natural paleness and habitually quiet mouse-like ways, made any symptoms of fatigue and suffering less noticeable. And her singing--the one thing in which she ceased to be passive, and became prominent--lost none of its energy. She herself sometimes wondered how it was that, whether she felt sad or angry, crushed with the sense of Anthony\u2019s indifference, or burning with impatience under Miss Assher\u2019s attentions, it was always a relief to her to sing. Those full deep notes she sent forth seemed to be lifting the pain from her heart--seemed to be carrying away the madness from her brain.

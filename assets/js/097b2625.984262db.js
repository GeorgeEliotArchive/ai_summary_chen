Godfrey\u2019s mind was too full of Nancy Lammeter\u2019s looks and behaviour, too full of the exasperation against himself and his lot, which the sight of her always produced in him, for him to give much thought to Wildfire, or to the probabilities of Dunstan\u2019s conduct. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"The next morning the whole village was excited by the story of the robbery, and Godfrey, like every one else, was occupied in gathering and discussing news about it, and in visiting the Stone-pits. The rain had washed away all possibility of distinguishing foot-marks, but a close investigation of the spot had disclosed, in the direction opposite to the village, a tinder-box, with a flint and steel, half sunk in the mud. It was not Silas\u2019s tinder-box, for the only one he had ever had was still standing on his shelf; and the inference generally accepted was, that the tinder-box in the ditch was somehow connected with the robbery. A small minority shook their heads, and intimated their opinion that it was not a robbery to have much light thrown on it by tinder-boxes, that Master Marner\u2019s tale had a queer look with it, and that such things had been known as a man\u2019s doing himself a mischief, and then setting the justice to look for the doer. But when questioned closely as to their grounds for this opinion, and what Master Marner had to gain by such false pretences, they only shook their heads as before, and observed that there was no knowing what some folks counted gain; moreover, that everybody had a right to their own opinions, grounds or no grounds, and that the weaver, as everybody knew, was partly crazy. Mr. Macey, though he joined in the defence of Marner against all suspicions of deceit, also pooh-poohed the tinder-box; indeed, repudiated it as a rather impious suggestion, tending to imply that everything must be done by human hands, and that there was no power which could make away with the guineas without moving the bricks. Nevertheless, he turned round rather sharply on Mr. Tookey, when the zealous deputy, feeling that this was a view of the case peculiarly suited to a parish-clerk, carried it still farther, and doubted whether it was right to inquire into a robbery at all when the circumstances were so mysterious. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cAs if,\u201d concluded Mr. Tookey\u2014\u201cas if there was nothing but what could be made out by justices and constables.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\u201cNow, don\u2019t you be for overshooting the mark, Tookey,\u201d said Mr. Macey, nodding his head aside admonishingly. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re allays at; if I throw a stone and hit, you think there\u2019s summat better than hitting, and you try to throw a stone beyond. What I said was against the tinder-box: I said nothing against justices and constables, for they\u2019re o\u2019 King George\u2019s making, and it \u2019ud be ill-becoming a man in a parish office to fly out again\u2019 King George.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"While these discussions were going on amongst the group outside the Rainbow, a higher consultation was being carried on within, under the presidency of Mr. Crackenthorp, the rector, assisted by Squire Cass and other substantial parishioners. It had just occurred to Mr. Snell, the landlord\u2014he being, as he observed, a man accustomed to put two and two together\u2014to connect with the tinder-box, which, as deputy-constable, he himself had had the honourable distinction of finding, certain recollections of a pedlar who had called to drink at the house about a month before, and had actually stated that he carried a tinder-box about with him to light his pipe. Here, surely, was a clue to be followed out. And as memory, when duly impregnated with ascertained facts, is sometimes surprisingly fertile, Mr. Snell gradually recovered a vivid impression of the effect produced on him by the pedlar\u2019s countenance and conversation. He had a \u201clook with his eye\u201d which fell unpleasantly on Mr. Snell\u2019s sensitive organism. To be sure, he didn\u2019t say anything particular\u2014no, except that about the tinder-box\u2014but it isn\u2019t what a man says, it\u2019s the way he says it. Moreover, he had a swarthy foreignness of complexion which boded little honesty.

After stretching the corners of his mouth and contracting his eyes, as if he were trying to see the ear-rings, he appeared to give up the effort, and said, \u201cWell, he\u2019d got ear-rings in his box to sell, so it\u2019s nat\u2019ral to suppose he might wear \u2019em. But he called at every house, a\u2019most, in the village; there\u2019s somebody else, mayhap, saw \u2019em in his ears, though I can\u2019t take upon me rightly to say.\u201d "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Mr. Snell was correct in his surmise, that somebody else would remember the pedlar\u2019s ear-rings. For on the spread of inquiry among the villagers it was stated with gathering emphasis, that the parson had wanted to know whether the pedlar wore ear-rings in his ears, and an impression was created that a great deal depended on the eliciting of this fact. Of course, every one who heard the question, not having any distinct image of the pedlar as ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"without")," ear-rings, immediately had an image of him ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"with")," ear-rings, larger or smaller, as the case might be; and the image was presently taken for a vivid recollection, so that the glazier\u2019s wife, a well-intentioned woman, not given to lying, and whose house was among the cleanest in the village, was ready to declare, as sure as ever she meant to take the sacrament the very next Christmas that was ever coming, that she had seen big ear-rings, in the shape of the young moon, in the pedlar\u2019s two ears; while Jinny Oates, the cobbler\u2019s daughter, being a more imaginative person, stated not only that she had seen them too, but that they had made her blood creep, as it did at that very moment while there she stood. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Also, by way of throwing further light on this clue of the tinder-box, a collection was made of all the articles purchased from the pedlar at various houses, and carried to the Rainbow to be exhibited there. In fact, there was a general feeling in the village, that for the clearing-up of this robbery there must be a great deal done at the Rainbow, and that no man need offer his wife an excuse for going there while it was the scene of severe public duties. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Some disappointment was felt, and perhaps a little indignation also, when it became known that Silas Marner, on being questioned by the Squire and the parson, had retained no other recollection of the pedlar than that he had called at his door, but had not entered his house, having turned away at once when Silas, holding the door ajar, had said that he wanted nothing. This had been Silas\u2019s testimony, though he clutched strongly at the idea of the pedlar\u2019s being the culprit, if only because it gave him a definite image of a whereabout for his gold after it had been taken away from its hiding-place: he could see it now in the pedlar\u2019s box. But it was observed with some irritation in the village, that anybody but a \u201cblind creatur\u201d like Marner would have seen the man prowling about, for how came he to leave his tinder-box in the ditch close by, if he hadn\u2019t been lingering there? Doubtless, he had made his observations when he saw Marner at the door. Anybody might know\u2014and only look at him\u2014that the weaver was a half-crazy miser. It was a wonder the pedlar hadn\u2019t murdered him; men of that sort, with rings in their ears, had been known for murderers often and often; there had been one tried at the \u2019sizes, not so long ago but what there were people living who remembered it. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Godfrey Cass, indeed, entering the Rainbow during one of Mr. Snell\u2019s frequently repeated recitals of his testimony, had treated it lightly, stating that he himself had bought a pen-knife of the pedlar, and thought him a merry grinning fellow enough; it was all nonsense, he said, about the man\u2019s evil looks. But this was spoken of in the village as the random talk of youth, \u201cas if it was only Mr. Snell who had seen something odd about the pedlar!\u201d On the contrary, there were at least half-a-dozen who were ready to go before Justice Malam, and give in much more striking testimony than any the landlord could furnish. It was to be hoped Mr. Godfrey would not go to Tarley and throw cold water on what Mr. Snell said there, and so prevent the justice from drawing up a warrant. He was suspected of intending this, when, after mid-day, he was seen setting off on horseback in the direction of Tarley. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"But by this time Godfrey\u2019s interest in the robbery had faded before his growing anxiety about Dunstan and Wildfire, and he was going, not to Tarley, but to Batherley, unable to rest in uncertainty about them any longer. The possibility that Dunstan had played him the ugly trick of riding away with Wildfire, to return at the end of a month, when he had gambled away or otherwise squandered the price of the horse, was a fear that urged itself upon him more, even, than the thought of an accidental injury; and now that the dance at Mrs. Osgood\u2019s was past, he was irritated with himself that he had trusted his horse to Dunstan. Instead of trying to still his fears, he encouraged them, with that superstitious impression which clings to us all, that if we expect evil very strongly it is the less likely to come; and when he heard a horse approaching at a trot, and saw a hat rising above a hedge beyond an angle of the lane, he felt as if his conjuration had succeeded. But no sooner did the horse come within sight, than his heart sank again. It was not Wildfire; and in a few moments more he discerned that the rider was not Dunstan, but Bryce, who pulled up to speak, with a face that implied something disagreeable.

The revelation about the money must be made the very next morning; and if he withheld the rest, Dunstan would be sure to come back shortly, and, finding that he must bear the brunt of his father\u2019s anger, would tell the whole story out of spite, even though he had nothing to gain by it. There was one step, perhaps, by which he might still win Dunstan\u2019s silence and put off the evil day: he might tell his father that he had himself spent the money paid to him by Fowler; and as he had never been guilty of such an offence before, the affair would blow over after a little storming. But Godfrey could not bend himself to this. He felt that in letting Dunstan have the money, he had already been guilty of a breach of trust hardly less culpable than that of spending the money directly for his own behoof; and yet there was a distinction between the two acts which made him feel that the one was so much more blackening than the other as to be intolerable to him.

The old Squire was accustomed to his son\u2019s frequent absence from home, and thought neither Dunstan\u2019s nor Wildfire\u2019s non-appearance a matter calling for remark. Godfrey said to himself again and again, that if he let slip this one opportunity of confession, he might never have another; the revelation might be made even in a more odious way than by Dunstan\u2019s malignity: ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"she")," might come as she had threatened to do. And then he tried to make the scene easier to himself by rehearsal: he made up his mind how he would pass from the admission of his weakness in letting Dunstan have the money to the fact that Dunstan had a hold on him which he had been unable to shake off, and how he would work up his father to expect something very bad before he told him the fact. The old Squire was an implacable man: he made resolutions in violent anger, and he was not to be moved from them after his anger had subsided\u2014as fiery volcanic matters cool and harden into rock. Like many violent and implacable men, he allowed evils to grow under favour of his own heedlessness, till they pressed upon him with exasperating force, and then he turned round with fierce severity and became unrelentingly hard. This was his system with his tenants: he allowed them to get into arrears, neglect their fences, reduce their stock, sell their straw, and otherwise go the wrong way,\u2014and then, when he became short of money in consequence of this indulgence, he took the hardest measures and would listen to no appeal. Godfrey knew all this, and felt it with the greater force because he had constantly suffered annoyance from witnessing his father\u2019s sudden fits of unrelentingness, for which his own habitual irresolution deprived him of all sympathy. (He was not critical on the faulty indulgence which preceded these fits; ",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"that")," seemed to him natural enough.) Still there was just the chance, Godfrey thought, that his father\u2019s pride might see this marriage in a light that would induce him to hush it up, rather than turn his son out and make the family the talk of the country for ten miles round. "),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"This was the view of the case that Godfrey managed to keep before him pretty closely till midnight, and he went to sleep thinking that he had done with inward debating. But when he awoke in the still morning darkness he found it impossible to reawaken his evening thoughts; it was as if they had been tired out and were not to be roused to further work. Instead of arguments for confession, he could now feel the presence of nothing but its evil consequences: the old dread of disgrace came back\u2014the old shrinking from the thought of raising a hopeless barrier between himself and Nancy\u2014the old disposition to rely on chances which might be favourable to him, and save him from betrayal. Why, after all, should he cut off the hope of them by his own act? He had seen the matter in a wrong light yesterday. He had been in a rage with Dunstan, and had thought of nothing but a thorough break-up of their mutual understanding; but what it would be really wisest for him to do, was to try and soften his father\u2019s anger against Dunsey, and keep things as nearly as possible in their old condition.

The neat little lady in mourning, whose light-brown ringlets are falling over the coloured embroidery with which her fingers are busy, is of course Lucy Deane; and the fine young man who is leaning down from his chair to snap the scissors in the extremely abbreviated face of the \u201cKing Charles\u201d lying on the young lady\u2019s feet is no other than Mr Stephen Guest, whose diamond ring, attar of roses, and air of ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"nonchalant")," leisure, at twelve o\u2019clock in the day, are the graceful and odoriferous result of the largest oil-mill and the most extensive wharf in St Ogg\u2019s. There is an apparent triviality in the action with the scissors, but your discernment perceives at once that there is a design in it which makes it eminently worthy of a large-headed, long-limbed young man; for you see that Lucy wants the scissors, and is compelled, reluctant as she may be, to shake her ringlets back, raise her soft hazel eyes, smile playfully down on the face that is so very nearly on a level with her knee, and holding out her little shell-pink palm, to say,\u2014 "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cMy scissors, please, if you can renounce the great pleasure of persecuting my poor Minny.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  The foolish scissors have slipped too far over the knuckles, it seems, and Hercules holds out his entrapped fingers hopelessly.

There were very painful circumstances, I believe. I never quite understood them, or knew them all. My uncle Tulliver was unfortunate and lost all his property, and I think he considered Mr Wakem was somehow the cause of it. Mr Wakem bought Dorlcote Mill, my uncle\u2019s old place, where he always lived. You must remember my uncle Tulliver, don\u2019t you?\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo,\u201d said Stephen, with rather supercilious indifference. \u201cI\u2019ve always known the name, and I dare say I knew the man by sight, apart from his name. I know half the names and faces in the neighbourhood in that detached, disjointed way.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHe was a very hot-tempered man. I remember, when I was a little girl and used to go to see my cousins, he often frightened me by talking as if he were angry. Papa told me there was a dreadful quarrel, the very day before my uncle\u2019s death, between him and Mr Wakem, but it was hushed up. That was when you were in London. Papa says my uncle was quite mistaken in many ways; his mind had become embittered. But Tom and Maggie must naturally feel it very painful to be reminded of these things. They have had so much, so very much trouble. Maggie was at school with me six years ago, when she was fetched away because of her father\u2019s misfortunes, and she has hardly had any pleasure since, I think. She has been in a dreary situation in a school since uncle\u2019s death, because she is determined to be independent, and not live with aunt Pullet; and I could hardly wish her to come to me then, because dear mamma was ill, and everything was so sad. That is why I want her to come to me now, and have a long, long holiday.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cVery sweet and angelic of you,\u201d said Stephen, looking at her with an admiring smile; \u201cand all the more so if she has the conversational qualities of her mother.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cPoor aunty! You are cruel to ridicule her. She is very valuable to ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"me"),", I know.

You must have seen her!\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cNo, indeed; I\u2019m only guessing what Mrs Tulliver\u2019s daughter must be; and then if she is to banish Philip, our only apology for a tenor, that will be an additional bore.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut I hope that may not be. I think I will ask you to call on Philip and tell him Maggie is coming to-morrow. He is quite aware of Tom\u2019s feeling, and always keeps out of his way; so he will understand, if you tell him, that I asked you to warn him not to come until I write to ask him.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI think you had better write a pretty note for me to take; Phil is so sensitive, you know, the least thing might frighten him off coming at all, and we had hard work to get him.

It is only your fa\xebry touch that can lay his ruffled feathers.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  Stephen mastered the little hand that was straying toward the table, and touched it lightly with his lips. Little Lucy felt very proud and happy. She and Stephen were in that stage of courtship which makes the most exquisite moment of youth, the freshest blossom-time of passion,\u2014when each is sure of the other\u2019s love, but no formal declaration has been made, and all is mutual divination, exalting the most trivial word, the lightest gesture, into thrills delicate and delicious as wafted jasmine scent. The explicitness of an engagement wears off this finest edge of susceptibility; it is jasmine gathered and presented in a large bouquet. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cBut it is really odd that you should have hit so exactly on Maggie\u2019s appearance and manners,\u201d said the cunning Lucy, moving to reach her desk, \u201cbecause she might have been like her brother, you know; and Tom has not round eyes; and he is as far as possible from staring at people.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, I suppose he is like the father; he seems to be as proud as Lucifer. Not a brilliant companion, though, I should think.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI like Tom. He gave me my Minny when I lost Lolo; and papa is very fond of him: he says Tom has excellent principles. It was through him that his father was able to pay all his debts before he died.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, ah; I\u2019ve heard about that. I heard your father and mine talking about it a little while ago, after dinner, in one of their interminable discussions about business. They think of doing something for young Tulliver; he saved them from a considerable loss by riding home in some marvellous way, like Turpin, to bring them news about the stoppage of a bank, or something of that sort. But I was rather drowsy at the time.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  Stephen rose from his seat, and sauntered to the piano, humming in falsetto, \u201cGraceful Consort,\u201d as he turned over the volume of \u201cThe Creation,\u201d which stood open on the desk. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cCome and sing this,\u201d he said, when he saw Lucy rising. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat, \u2018Graceful Consort\u2019?

I notice men with indifferent voices are usually of that opinion.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cPhilip burst into one of his invectives against \u2018The Creation\u2019 the other day,\u201d said Lucy, seating herself at the piano. \u201cHe says it has a sort of sugared complacency and flattering make-believe in it, as if it were written for the birthday ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"f\xeate")," of a German Grand-Duke.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, pooh!

"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  Surely the only courtship unshaken by doubts and fears must be that in which the lovers can sing together. The sense of mutual fitness that springs from the two deep notes fulfilling expectation just at the right moment between the notes of the silvery soprano, from the perfect accord of descending thirds and fifths, from the preconcerted loving chase of a fugue, is likely enough to supersede any immediate demand for less impassioned forms of agreement. The contralto will not care to catechise the bass; the tenor will foresee no embarrassing dearth of remark in evenings spent with the lovely soprano. In the provinces, too, where music was so scarce in that remote time, how could the musical people avoid falling in love with each other? Even political principle must have been in danger of relaxation under such circumstances; and the violin, faithful to rotten boroughs, must have been tempted to fraternise in a demoralizing way with a reforming violoncello. In that case, the linnet-throated soprano and the full-toned bass singing,\u2014 "),(0,i.yg)("pre",null,(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre"},"   \u201cWith thee delight is ever new,      With thee is life incessant bliss,\u201d \n")),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  believed what they sang all the more ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"because")," they sang it.

Well, I can just sing this.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  Stephen delivered with admirable ease the deep notes representing the tread of the heavy beasts; but when a singer has an audience of two, there is room for divided sentiments. Minny\u2019s mistress was charmed; but Minny, who had intrenched himself, trembling, in his basket as soon as the music began, found this thunder so little to his taste that he leaped out and scampered under the remotest ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"chiffonnier"),", as the most eligible place in which a small dog could await the crack of doom. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAdieu, \u2018graceful consort,\u2019\u201d said Stephen, buttoning his coat across when he had done singing, and smiling down from his tall height, with the air of rather a patronizing lover, at the little lady on the music-stool. \u201cMy bliss is not incessant, for I must gallop home. I promised to be there at lunch.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou will not be able to call on Philip, then? It is of no consequence; I have said everything in my note.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYou will be engaged with your cousin to-morrow, I suppose?\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, we are going to have a little family-party.

Come and be introduced to my cousin Maggie; though you can hardly be said not to have seen her, you have described her so well.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cGood-bye, then.\u201d And there was that slight pressure of the hands, and momentary meeting of the eyes, which will often leave a little lady with a slight flush and smile on her face that do not subside immediately when the door is closed, and with an inclination to walk up and down the room rather than to seat herself quietly at her embroidery, or other rational and improving occupation. At least this was the effect on Lucy; and you will not, I hope, consider it an indication of vanity predominating over more tender impulses, that she just glanced in the chimney-glass as her walk brought her near it. The desire to know that one has not looked an absolute fright during a few hours of conversation may be construed as lying within the bounds of a laudable benevolent consideration for others. And Lucy had so much of this benevolence in her nature that I am inclined to think her small egoisms were impregnated with it, just as there are people not altogether unknown to you whose small benevolences have a predominant and somewhat rank odor of egoism. Even now, that she is walking up and down with a little triumphant flutter of her girlish heart at the sense that she is loved by the person of chief consequence in her small world, you may see in her hazel eyes an ever-present sunny benignity, in which the momentary harmless flashes of personal vanity are quite lost; and if she is happy in thinking of her lover, it is because the thought of him mingles readily with all the gentle affections and good-natured offices with which she fills her peaceful days. Even now, her mind, with that instantaneous alternation which makes two currents of feeling or imagination seem simultaneous, is glancing continually from Stephen to the preparations she has only half finished in Maggie\u2019s room. Cousin Maggie should be treated as well as the grandest lady-visitor,\u2014nay, better, for she should have Lucy\u2019s best prints and drawings in her bedroom, and the very finest bouquet of spring flowers on her table. Maggie would enjoy all that, she was so found of pretty things! And there was poor aunt Tulliver, that no one made any account of, she was to be surprised with the present of a cap of superlative quality, and to have her health drunk in a gratifying manner, for which Lucy was going to lay a plot with her father this evening. Clearly, she had not time to indulge in long reveries about her own happy love-affairs. With this thought she walked toward the door, but paused there. "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, then, Minny?\u201d she said, stooping in answer to some whimpering of that small quadruped, and lifting his glossy head against her pink cheek. \u201cDid you think I was going without you? Come, then, let us go and see Sinbad.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  Sinbad was Lucy\u2019s chestnut horse, that she always fed with her own hand when he was turned out in the paddock. She was fond of feeding dependent creatures, and knew the private tastes of all the animals about the house, delighting in the little rippling sounds of her canaries when their beaks were busy with fresh seed, and in the small nibbling pleasures of certain animals which, lest she should appear too trivial, I will here call \u201cthe more familiar rodents.\u201d "),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"  Was not Stephen Guest right in his decided opinion that this slim maiden of eighteen was quite the sort of wife a man would not be likely to repent of marrying,\u2014a woman who was loving and thoughtful for other women, not giving them Judas-kisses with eyes askance on their welcome defects, but with real care and vision for their half-hidden pains and mortifications, with long ruminating enjoyment of little pleasures prepared for them? Perhaps the emphasis of his admiration did not fall precisely on this rarest quality in her; perhaps he approved his own choice of her chiefly because she did not strike him as a remarkable rarity. A man likes his wife to be pretty; well, Lucy was pretty, but not to a maddening extent. A man likes his wife to be accomplished, gentle, affectionate, and not stupid; and Lucy had all these qualifications. Stephen was not surprised to find himself in love with her, and was conscious of excellent judgment in preferring her to Miss Leyburn, the daughter of the county member, although Lucy was only the daughter of his father\u2019s subordinate partner; besides, he had had to defy and overcome a slight unwillingness and disappointment in his father and sisters,\u2014a circumstance which gives a young man an agreeable consciousness of his own dignity. Stephen was aware that he had sense and independence enough to choose the wife who was likely to make him happy, unbiassed by any indirect considerations. He meant to choose Lucy; she was a little darling, and exactly the sort of woman he had always admired."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

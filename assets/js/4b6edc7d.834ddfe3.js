It had been settled very definitely what Mr. Poyser was to do when the young squire should appear, and for the last five minutes he had been in a state of abstraction, with his eyes fixed on the dark picture opposite, and his hands busy with the loose cash and other articles in his breeches pockets. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  When the young squire entered, with Mr. Irwine by his side, every one stood up, and this moment of homage was very agreeable to Arthur. He liked to feel his own importance, and besides that, he cared a great deal for the good-will of these people: he was fond of thinking that they had a hearty, special regard for him. The pleasure he felt was in his face as he said, \u201cMy grandfather and I hope all our friends here have enjoyed their dinner, and find my birthday ale good. Mr. Irwine and I are come to taste it with you, and I am sure we shall all like anything the better that the rector shares with us.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  All eyes were now turned on Mr. Poyser, who, with his hands still busy in his pockets, began with the deliberateness of a slow-striking clock. \u201cCaptain, my neighbours have put it upo\u2019 me to speak for \u2019em to-day, for where folks think pretty much alike, one spokesman\u2019s as good as a score.

We\u2019ve pretty nigh all on us known you when you war a little un, an\u2019 we\u2019ve niver known anything on you but what was good an\u2019 honorable. You speak fair an\u2019 y\u2019 act fair, an\u2019 we\u2019re joyful when we look forrard to your being our landlord, for we \u2019lieve you mean to do right by everybody, an\u2019 \u2019ull make no man\u2019s bread bitter to him if you can help it.

An\u2019 as for the rector\u2019s company, it\u2019s well known as that\u2019s welcome t\u2019 all the parish wherever he may be; an\u2019 I hope, an\u2019 we all hope, as he\u2019ll live to see us old folks, an\u2019 our children grown to men an\u2019 women an\u2019 Your Honour a family man.

Arthur had felt a twinge of conscience during Mr. Poyser\u2019s speech, but it was too feeble to nullify the pleasure he felt in being praised. Did he not deserve what was said of him on the whole? If there was something in his conduct that Poyser wouldn\u2019t have liked if he had known it, why, no man\u2019s conduct will bear too close an inspection; and Poyser was not likely to know it; and, after all, what had he done?

It was necessary to Arthur, you perceive, to be satisfied with himself. Uncomfortable thoughts must be got rid of by good intentions for the future, which can be formed so rapidly that he had time to be uncomfortable and to become easy again before Mr. Poyser\u2019s slow speech was finished, and when it was time for him to speak he was quite light-hearted. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI thank you all, my good friends and neighbours,\u201d Arthur said, \u201cfor the good opinion of me, and the kind feelings towards me which Mr. Poyser has been expressing on your behalf and on his own, and it will always be my heartiest wish to deserve them. In the course of things we may expect that, if I live, I shall one day or other be your landlord; indeed, it is on the ground of that expectation that my grandfather has wished me to celebrate this day and to come among you now; and I look forward to this position, not merely as one of power and pleasure for myself, but as a means of benefiting my neighbours. It hardly becomes so young a man as I am to talk much about farming to you, who are most of you so much older, and are men of experience; still, I have interested myself a good deal in such matters, and learned as much about them as my opportunities have allowed; and when the course of events shall place the estate in my hands, it will be my first desire to afford my tenants all the encouragement a landlord can give them, in improving their land and trying to bring about a better practice of husbandry. It will be my wish to be looked on by all my deserving tenants as their best friend, and nothing would make me so happy as to be able to respect every man on the estate, and to be respected by him in return. It is not my place at present to enter into particulars; I only meet your good hopes concerning me by telling you that my own hopes correspond to them\u2014that what you expect from me I desire to fulfil; and I am quite of Mr. Poyser\u2019s opinion, that when a man has said what he means, he had better stop. But the pleasure I feel in having my own health drunk by you would not be perfect if we did not drink the health of my grandfather, who has filled the place of both parents to me. I will say no more, until you have joined me in drinking his health on a day when he has wished me to appear among you as the future representative of his name and family.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Perhaps there was no one present except Mr. Irwine who thoroughly understood and approved Arthur\u2019s graceful mode of proposing his grandfather\u2019s health. The farmers thought the young squire knew well enough that they hated the old squire, and Mrs. Poyser said, \u201che\u2019d better not ha\u2019 stirred a kettle o\u2019 sour broth.\u201d The bucolic mind does not readily apprehend the refinements of good taste. But the toast could not be rejected and when it had been drunk, Arthur said, \u201cI thank you, both for my grandfather and myself; and now there is one more thing I wish to tell you, that you may share my pleasure about it, as I hope and believe you will. I think there can be no man here who has not a respect, and some of you, I am sure, have a very high regard, for my friend Adam Bede. It is well known to every one in this neighbourhood that there is no man whose word can be more depended on than his; that whatever he undertakes to do, he does well, and is as careful for the interests of those who employ him as for his own. I\u2019m proud to say that I was very fond of Adam when I was a little boy, and I have never lost my old feeling for him\u2014I think that shows that I know a good fellow when I find him. It has long been my wish that he should have the management of the woods on the estate, which happen to be very valuable, not only because I think so highly of his character, but because he has the knowledge and the skill which fit him for the place. And I am happy to tell you that it is my grandfather\u2019s wish too, and it is now settled that Adam shall manage the woods\u2014a change which I am sure will be very much for the advantage of the estate; and I hope you will by and by join me in drinking his health, and in wishing him all the prosperity in life that he deserves. But there is a still older friend of mine than Adam Bede present, and I need not tell you that it is Mr. Irwine. I\u2019m sure you will agree with me that we must drink no other person\u2019s health until we have drunk his. I know you have all reason to love him, but no one of his parishioners has so much reason as I. Come, charge your glasses, and let us drink to our excellent rector\u2014three times three!\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  This toast was drunk with all the enthusiasm that was wanting to the last, and it certainly was the most picturesque moment in the scene when Mr. Irwine got up to speak, and all the faces in the room were turned towards him. The superior refinement of his face was much more striking than that of Arthur\u2019s when seen in comparison with the people round them. Arthur\u2019s was a much commoner British face, and the splendour of his new-fashioned clothes was more akin to the young farmer\u2019s taste in costume than Mr. Irwine\u2019s powder and the well-brushed but well-worn black, which seemed to be his chosen suit for great occasions; for he had the mysterious secret of never wearing a new-looking coat. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThis is not the first time, by a great many,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I have had to thank my parishioners for giving me tokens of their goodwill, but neighbourly kindness is among those things that are the more precious the older they get. Indeed, our pleasant meeting to-day is a proof that when what is good comes of age and is likely to live, there is reason for rejoicing, and the relation between us as clergyman and parishioners came of age two years ago, for it is three-and-twenty years since I first came among you, and I see some tall fine-looking young men here, as well as some blooming young women, that were far from looking as pleasantly at me when I christened them as I am happy to see them looking now. But I\u2019m sure you will not wonder when I say that among all those young men, the one in whom I have the strongest interest is my friend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne, for whom you have just expressed your regard. I had the pleasure of being his tutor for several years, and have naturally had opportunities of knowing him intimately which cannot have occurred to any one else who is present; and I have some pride as well as pleasure in assuring you that I share your high hopes concerning him, and your confidence in his possession of those qualities which will make him an excellent landlord when the time shall come for him to take that important position among you. We feel alike on most matters on which a man who is getting towards fifty can feel in common with a young man of one-and-twenty, and he has just been expressing a feeling which I share very heartily, and I would not willingly omit the opportunity of saying so. That feeling is his value and respect for Adam Bede. People in a high station are of course more thought of and talked about and have their virtues more praised, than those whose lives are passed in humble everyday work; but every sensible man knows how necessary that humble everyday work is, and how important it is to us that it should be done well. And I agree with my friend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne in feeling that when a man whose duty lies in that sort of work shows a character which would make him an example in any station, his merit should be acknowledged. He is one of those to whom honour is due, and his friends should delight to honour him. I know Adam Bede well\u2014I know what he is as a workman, and what he has been as a son and brother\u2014and I am saying the simplest truth when I say that I respect him as much as I respect any man living. But I am not speaking to you about a stranger; some of you are his intimate friends, and I believe there is not one here who does not know enough of him to join heartily in drinking his health.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  As Mr. Irwine paused, Arthur jumped up and, filling his glass, said, \u201cA bumper to Adam Bede, and may he live to have sons as faithful and clever as himself!\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  No hearer, not even Bartle Massey, was so delighted with this toast as Mr. Poyser. \u201cTough work\u201d as his first speech had been, he would have started up to make another if he had not known the extreme irregularity of such a course. As it was, he found an outlet for his feeling in drinking his ale unusually fast, and setting down his glass with a swing of his arm and a determined rap. If Jonathan Burge and a few others felt less comfortable on the occasion, they tried their best to look contented, and so the toast was drunk with a goodwill apparently unanimous. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam was rather paler than usual when he got up to thank his friends. He was a good deal moved by this public tribute\u2014very naturally, for he was in the presence of all his little world, and it was uniting to do him honour. But he felt no shyness about speaking, not being troubled with small vanity or lack of words; he looked neither awkward nor embarrassed, but stood in his usual firm upright attitude, with his head thrown a little backward and his hands perfectly still, in that rough dignity which is peculiar to intelligent, honest, well-built workmen, who are never wondering what is their business in the world. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI\u2019m quite taken by surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything o\u2019 this sort, for it\u2019s a good deal more than my wages. But I\u2019ve the more reason to be grateful to you, Captain, and to you, Mr. Irwine, and to all my friends here, who\u2019ve drunk my health and wished me well. It \u2019ud be nonsense for me to be saying, I don\u2019t at all deserve th\u2019 opinion you have of me; that \u2019ud be poor thanks to you, to say that you\u2019ve known me all these years and yet haven\u2019t sense enough to find out a great deal o\u2019 the truth about me. You think, if I undertake to do a bit o\u2019 work, I\u2019ll do it well, be my pay big or little\u2014and that\u2019s true. I\u2019d be ashamed to stand before you here if it wasna true. But it seems to me that\u2019s a man\u2019s plain duty, and nothing to be conceited about, and it\u2019s pretty clear to me as I\u2019ve never done more than my duty; for let us do what we will, it\u2019s only making use o\u2019 the sperrit and the powers that ha\u2019 been given to us. And so this kindness o\u2019 yours, I\u2019m sure, is no debt you owe me, but a free gift, and as such I accept it and am thankful. And as to this new employment I\u2019ve taken in hand, I\u2019ll only say that I took it at Captain Donnithorne\u2019s desire, and that I\u2019ll try to fulfil his expectations. I\u2019d wish for no better lot than to work under him, and to know that while I was getting my own bread I was taking care of his int\u2019rests. For I believe he\u2019s one o\u2019 those gentlemen as wishes to do the right thing, and to leave the world a bit better than he found it, which it\u2019s my belief every man may do, whether he\u2019s gentle or simple, whether he sets a good bit o\u2019 work going and finds the money, or whether he does the work with his own hands. There\u2019s no occasion for me to say any more about what I feel towards him: I hope to show it through the rest o\u2019 my life in my actions.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There were various opinions about Adam\u2019s speech: some of the women whispered that he didn\u2019t show himself thankful enough, and seemed to speak as proud as could be; but most of the men were of opinion that nobody could speak more straightfor\u2019ard, and that Adam was as fine a chap as need to be. While such observations were being buzzed about, mingled with wonderings as to what the old squire meant to do for a bailiff, and whether he was going to have a steward, the two gentlemen had risen, and were walking round to the table where the wives and children sat. There was none of the strong ale here, of course, but wine and dessert\u2014sparkling gooseberry for the young ones, and some good sherry for the mothers. Mrs. Poyser was at the head of this table, and Totty was now seated in her lap, bending her small nose deep down into a wine-glass in search of the nuts floating there. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cHow do you do, Mrs. Poyser?\u201d said Arthur. \u201cWeren\u2019t you pleased to hear your husband make such a good speech to-day?\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cOh, sir, the men are mostly so tongue-tied\u2014you\u2019re forced partly to guess what they mean, as you do wi\u2019 the dumb creaturs.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat! you think you could have made it better for him?\u201d said Mr. Irwine, laughing.

Arthur did not venture to stop near Hetty, but merely bowed to her as he passed along the opposite side. The foolish child felt her heart swelling with discontent; for what woman was ever satisfied with apparent neglect, even when she knows it to be the mask of love? Hetty thought this was going to be the most miserable day she had had for a long while, a moment of chill daylight and reality came across her dream: Arthur, who had seemed so near to her only a few hours before, was separated from her, as the hero of a great procession is separated from a small outsider in the crowd."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

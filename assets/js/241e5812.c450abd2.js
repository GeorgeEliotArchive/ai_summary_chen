Throughout the day, except in her occasional outbursts of wailing grief, she had been in incessant movement, performing the initial duties to her dead with the awe and exactitude that belong to religious rites. She had brought out her little store of bleached linen, which she had for long years kept in reserve for this supreme use. It seemed but yesterday\u2014that time so many midsummers ago, when she had told Thias where this linen lay, that he might be sure and reach it out for her when ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"she")," died, for she was the elder of the two. Then there had been the work of cleansing to the strictest purity every object in the sacred chamber, and of removing from it every trace of common daily occupation. The small window, which had hitherto freely let in the frosty moonlight or the warm summer sunrise on the working man\u2019s slumber, must now be darkened with a fair white sheet, for this was the sleep which is as sacred under the bare rafters as in ceiled houses. Lisbeth had even mended a long-neglected and unnoticeable rent in the checkered bit of bed-curtain; for the moments were few and precious now in which she would be able to do the smallest office of respect or love for the still corpse, to which in all her thoughts she attributed some consciousness. Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them: they can be injured by us, they can be wounded; they know all our penitence, all our aching sense that their place is empty, all the kisses we bestow on the smallest relic of their presence. And the aged peasant woman most of all believes that her dead are conscious. Decent burial was what Lisbeth had been thinking of for herself through years of thrift, with an indistinct expectation that she should know when she was being carried to the churchyard, followed by her husband and her sons; and now she felt as if the greatest work of her life were to be done in seeing that Thias was buried decently before her\u2014under the white thorn, where once, in a dream, she had thought she lay in the coffin, yet all the while saw the sunshine above and smelt the white blossoms that were so thick upon the thorn the Sunday she went to be churched after Adam was born. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But now she had done everything that could be done to-day in the chamber of death\u2014had done it all herself, with some aid from her sons in lifting, for she would let no one be fetched to help her from the village, not being fond of female neighbours generally; and her favourite Dolly, the old housekeeper at Mr. Burge\u2019s, who had come to condole with her in the morning as soon as she heard of Thias\u2019s death, was too dim-sighted to be of much use. She had locked the door, and now held the key in her hand, as she threw herself wearily into a chair that stood out of its place in the middle of the house floor, where in ordinary times she would never have consented to sit. The kitchen had had none of her attention that day; it was soiled with the tread of muddy shoes and untidy with clothes and other objects out of place. But what at another time would have been intolerable to Lisbeth\u2019s habits of order and cleanliness seemed to her now just what should be: it was right that things should look strange and disordered and wretched, now the old man had come to his end in that sad way; the kitchen ought not to look as if nothing had happened. Adam, overcome with the agitations and exertions of the day after his night of hard work, had fallen asleep on a bench in the workshop; and Seth was in the back kitchen making a fire of sticks that he might get the kettle to boil, and persuade his mother to have a cup of tea, an indulgence which she rarely allowed herself. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  There was no one in the kitchen when Lisbeth entered and threw herself into the chair. She looked round with blank eyes at the dirt and confusion on which the bright afternoon\u2019s sun shone dismally; it was all of a piece with the sad confusion of her mind\u2014that confusion which belongs to the first hours of a sudden sorrow, when the poor human soul is like one who has been deposited sleeping among the ruins of a vast city, and wakes up in dreary amazement, not knowing whether it is the growing or the dying day\u2014not knowing why and whence came this illimitable scene of desolation, or why he too finds himself desolate in the midst of it. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  At another time Lisbeth\u2019s first thought would have been, \u201cWhere is Adam?\u201d but the sudden death of her husband had restored him in these hours to that first place in her affections which he had held six-and-twenty years ago. She had forgotten his faults as we forget the sorrows of our departed childhood, and thought of nothing but the young husband\u2019s kindness and the old man\u2019s patience. Her eyes continued to wander blankly until Seth came in and began to remove some of the scattered things, and clear the small round deal table that he might set out his mother\u2019s tea upon it. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWhat art goin\u2019 to do?\u201d she said, rather peevishly. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI want thee to have a cup of tea, Mother,\u201d answered Seth, tenderly. \u201cIt\u2019ll do thee good; and I\u2019ll put two or three of these things away, and make the house look more comfortable.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cComfortable!

Seth, always timid in his behaviour towards his mother, from the sense that he had no influence over her, felt it was useless to attempt to persuade or soothe her till this passion was past; so he contented himself with tending the back kitchen fire and folding up his father\u2019s clothes, which had been hanging out to dry since morning\u2014afraid to move about in the room where his mother was, lest he should irritate her further. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  But after Lisbeth had been rocking herself and moaning for some minutes, she suddenly paused and said aloud to herself, \u201cI\u2019ll go an\u2019 see arter Adam, for I canna think where he\u2019s gotten; an\u2019 I want him to go upstairs wi\u2019 me afore it\u2019s dark, for the minutes to look at the corpse is like the meltin\u2019 snow.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Seth overheard this, and coming into the kitchen again, as his mother rose from her chair, he said, \u201cAdam\u2019s asleep in the workshop, mother. Thee\u2019dst better not wake him. He was o\u2019erwrought with work and trouble.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cWake him? Who\u2019s a-goin\u2019 to wake him?

I hanna seen the lad this two hour\u2014I\u2019d welly forgot as he\u2019d e\u2019er growed up from a babby when\u2019s feyther carried him.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Adam was seated on a rough bench, his head supported by his arm, which rested from the shoulder to the elbow on the long planing-table in the middle of the workshop. It seemed as if he had sat down for a few minutes\u2019 rest and had fallen asleep without slipping from his first attitude of sad, fatigued thought. His face, unwashed since yesterday, looked pallid and clammy; his hair was tossed shaggily about his forehead, and his closed eyes had the sunken look which follows upon watching and sorrow. His brow was knit, and his whole face had an expression of weariness and pain. Gyp was evidently uneasy, for he sat on his haunches, resting his nose on his master\u2019s stretched-out leg, and dividing the time between licking the hand that hung listlessly down and glancing with a listening air towards the door. The poor dog was hungry and restless, but would not leave his master, and was waiting impatiently for some change in the scene. It was owing to this feeling on Gyp\u2019s part that, when Lisbeth came into the workshop and advanced towards Adam as noiselessly as she could, her intention not to awaken him was immediately defeated; for Gyp\u2019s excitement was too great to find vent in anything short of a sharp bark, and in a moment Adam opened his eyes and saw his mother standing before him. It was not very unlike his dream, for his sleep had been little more than living through again, in a fevered delirious way, all that had happened since daybreak, and his mother with her fretful grief was present to him through it all. The chief difference between the reality and the vision was that in his dream Hetty was continually coming before him in bodily presence\u2014strangely mingling herself as an actor in scenes with which she had nothing to do. She was even by the Willow Brook; she made his mother angry by coming into the house; and he met her with her smart clothes quite wet through, as he walked in the rain to Treddleston, to tell the coroner. But wherever Hetty came, his mother was sure to follow soon; and when he opened his eyes, it was not at all startling to see her standing near him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cEh, my lad, my lad!\u201d Lisbeth burst out immediately, her wailing impulse returning, for grief in its freshness feels the need of associating its loss and its lament with every change of scene and incident, \u201cthee\u2019st got nobody now but thy old mother to torment thee and be a burden to thee. Thy poor feyther \u2019ull ne\u2019er anger thee no more; an\u2019 thy mother may\u2019s well go arter him\u2014the sooner the better\u2014for I\u2019m no good to nobody now.

An\u2019 I shall be nought but cumber, a-sittin\u2019 i\u2019 th\u2019 chimney-corner. (Adam winced and moved uneasily; he dreaded, of all things, to hear his mother speak of Hetty.) But if thy feyther had lived, he\u2019d ne\u2019er ha\u2019 wanted me to go to make room for another, for he could no more ha\u2019 done wi\u2019out me nor one side o\u2019 the scissars can do wi\u2019out th\u2019 other.

It was not possible for poor Lisbeth to know how it affected Adam any more than it is possible for a wounded dog to know how his moans affect the nerves of his master. Like all complaining women, she complained in the expectation of being soothed, and when Adam said nothing, she was only prompted to complain more bitterly. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cI know thee couldst do better wi\u2019out me, for thee couldst go where thee likedst an\u2019 marry them as thee likedst.

But Lisbeth followed him. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cThee wutna go upstairs an\u2019 see thy feyther then?

Come, Seth, let us go together.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  They went upstairs, and for five minutes all was silence. Then the key was turned again, and there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs. But Adam did not come down again; he was too weary and worn-out to encounter more of his mother\u2019s querulous grief, and he went to rest on his bed. Lisbeth no sooner entered the kitchen and sat down than she threw her apron over her head, and began to cry and moan and rock herself as before. Seth thought, \u201cShe will be quieter by and by, now we have been upstairs\u201d; and he went into the back kitchen again, to tend his little fire, hoping that he should presently induce her to have some tea. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Lisbeth had been rocking herself in this way for more than five minutes, giving a low moan with every forward movement of her body, when she suddenly felt a hand placed gently on hers, and a sweet treble voice said to her, \u201cDear sister, the Lord has sent me to see if I can be a comfort to you.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Lisbeth paused, in a listening attitude, without removing her apron from her face. The voice was strange to her. Could it be her sister\u2019s spirit come back to her from the dead after all those years? She trembled and dared not look. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Dinah, believing that this pause of wonder was in itself a relief for the sorrowing woman, said no more just yet, but quietly took off her bonnet, and then, motioning silence to Seth, who, on hearing her voice, had come in with a beating heart, laid one hand on the back of Lisbeth\u2019s chair and leaned over her, that she might be aware of a friendly presence. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  Slowly Lisbeth drew down her apron, and timidly she opened her dim dark eyes. She saw nothing at first but a face\u2014a pure, pale face, with loving grey eyes, and it was quite unknown to her. Her wonder increased; perhaps it ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"was")," an angel. But in the same instant Dinah had laid her hand on Lisbeth\u2019s again, and the old woman looked down at it. It was a much smaller hand than her own, but it was not white and delicate, for Dinah had never worn a glove in her life, and her hand bore the traces of labour from her childhood upwards. Lisbeth looked earnestly at the hand for a moment, and then, fixing her eyes again on Dinah\u2019s face, said, with something of restored courage, but in a tone of surprise, \u201cWhy, ye\u2019re a workin\u2019 woman!\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cYes, I am Dinah Morris, and I work in the cotton-mill when I am at home.\u201d "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  \u201cAh!\u201d said Lisbeth slowly, still wondering; \u201cye comed in so light, like the shadow on the wall, an\u2019 spoke i\u2019 my ear, as I thought ye might be a sperrit.

The old woman listened, and forgot to be fretful, unconsciously subject to the soothing influence of Dinah\u2019s face and voice. After a while she was persuaded to let the kitchen be made tidy; for Dinah was bent on this, believing that the sense of order and quietude around her would help in disposing Lisbeth to join in the prayer she longed to pour forth at her side.

Do you remember what David did, when God took away his child from him? While the child was yet alive he fasted and prayed to God to spare it, and he would neither eat nor drink, but lay on the ground all night, beseeching God for the child. But when he knew it was dead, he rose up from the ground and washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes, and ate and drank; and when they asked him how it was that he seemed to have left off grieving now the child was dead, he said, \u2018While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me, that the child may live?

This was what Dinah had been trying to bring about, through all her still sympathy and absence from exhortation. From her girlhood upwards she had had experience among the sick and the mourning, among minds hardened and shrivelled through poverty and ignorance, and had gained the subtlest perception of the mode in which they could best be touched and softened into willingness to receive words of spiritual consolation or warning. As Dinah expressed it, \u201cshe was never left to herself; but it was always given her when to keep silence and when to speak.\u201d And do we not all agree to call rapid thought and noble impulse by the name of inspiration? After our subtlest analysis of the mental process, we must still say, as Dinah did, that our highest thoughts and our best deeds are all given to us. "),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"  And so there was earnest prayer\u2014there was faith, love, and hope pouring forth that evening in the little kitchen. And poor, aged, fretful Lisbeth, without grasping any distinct idea, without going through any course of religious emotions, felt a vague sense of goodness and love, and of something right lying underneath and beyond all this sorrowing life. She couldn\u2019t understand the sorrow; but, for these moments, under the subduing influence of Dinah\u2019s spirit, she felt that she must be patient and still."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

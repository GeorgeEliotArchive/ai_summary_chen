The chapter features a discussion in the Donnithorne Arms about the arrival of a stranger who could potentially be the new tenant of the Chase Farm. Mr. Casson, the innkeeper, shares his encounter with the stranger, which leads to a humorous debate about language and dialect. The conversation continues the next day at church, where Martin Poyser hears the news. Later, the old squire Donnithorne visits the Poysers, and proposes a land exchange deal which would see the Poysers supplying dairy products to the Abbey. Mrs. Poyser, however, rejects the offer in a passionate outburst, citing the poor condition of their farm and the unfairness of the proposal. Despite the squire&#x27;s attempts to persuade her, she remains adamant. The chapter ends with the Poysers worrying about the possibility of having to move from their farm.</p><p><strong>Main Characters</strong>:

No one had thought of denying Mr. Casson‚Äôs testimony to the fact that he had seen the stranger; nevertheless, he proffered various corroborating circumstances. </p><p>  ‚ÄúI see him myself,‚Äù he said; ‚ÄúI see him coming along by the Crab-tree Meadow on a bald-faced hoss. I‚Äôd just been t‚Äô hev a pint‚Äîit was half after ten i‚Äô the fore-noon, when I hev my pint as reg‚Äôlar as the clock‚Äîand I says to Knowles, as druv up with his waggon, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôll get a bit o‚Äô barley to-day, Knowles,‚Äô I says, ‚Äòif you look about you‚Äô; and then I went round by the rick-yard, and towart the Treddles‚Äôon road, and just as I come up by the big ash-tree, I see the man i‚Äô top-boots coming along on a bald-faced hoss‚ÄîI wish I may never stir if I didn‚Äôt. And I stood still till he come up, and I says, ‚ÄòGood morning, sir,‚Äô I says, for I wanted to hear the turn of his tongue, as I might know whether he was a this-country man; so I says, ‚ÄòGood morning, sir: it ‚Äôll ‚Äôold hup for the barley this morning, I think. There‚Äôll be a bit got hin, if we‚Äôve good luck.‚Äô And he says, ‚ÄòEh, ye may be raight, there‚Äôs noo tallin‚Äô,‚Äô he says, and I knowed by that‚Äù‚Äîhere Mr. Casson gave a wink‚Äî‚Äúas he didn‚Äôt come from a hundred mile off. I daresay he‚Äôd think me a hodd talker, as you Loamshire folks allays does hany one as talks the right language.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúThe right language!‚Äù said Bartle Massey, contemptuously. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre about as near the right language as a pig‚Äôs squeaking is like a tune played on a key-bugle.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù answered Mr. Casson, with an angry smile. ‚ÄúI should think a man as has lived among the gentry from a by, is likely to know what‚Äôs the right language pretty nigh as well as a schoolmaster.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúAy, ay, man,‚Äù said Bartle, with a tone of sarcastic consolation, ‚Äúyou talk the right language for <em>you</em>. When Mike Holdsworth‚Äôs goat says ba-a-a, it‚Äôs all right‚Äîit ‚Äôud be unnatural for it to make any other noise.‚Äù </p><p>  The rest of the party being Loamshire men, Mr. Casson had the laugh strongly against him, and wisely fell back on the previous question, which, far from being exhausted in a single evening, was renewed in the churchyard, before service, the next day, with the fresh interest conferred on all news when there is a fresh person to hear it; and that fresh hearer was Martin Poyser, who, as his wife said, ‚Äúnever went boozin‚Äô with that set at Casson‚Äôs, a-sittin‚Äô soakin‚Äô in drink, and looking as wise as a lot o‚Äô cod-fish wi‚Äô red faces.‚Äù </p><p>  It was probably owing to the conversation she had had with her husband on their way from church concerning this problematic stranger that Mrs. Poyser‚Äôs thoughts immediately reverted to him when, a day or two afterwards, as she was standing at the house-door with her knitting, in that eager leisure which came to her when the afternoon cleaning was done, she saw the old squire enter the yard on his black pony, followed by John the groom. She always cited it afterwards as a case of prevision, which really had something more in it than her own remarkable penetration, that the moment she set eyes on the squire she said to herself, ‚ÄúI shouldna wonder if he‚Äôs come about that man as is a-going to take the Chase Farm, wanting Poyser to do something for him without pay. But Poyser‚Äôs a fool if he does.‚Äù </p><p>  Something unwonted must clearly be in the wind, for the old squire‚Äôs visits to his tenantry were rare; and though Mrs. Poyser had during the last twelvemonth recited many imaginary speeches, meaning even more than met the ear, which she was quite determined to make to him the next time he appeared within the gates of the Hall Farm, the speeches had always remained imaginary. </p><p>  ‚ÄúGood-day, Mrs. Poyser,‚Äù said the old squire, peering at her with his short-sighted eyes‚Äîa mode of looking at her which, as Mrs. Poyser observed, ‚Äúallays aggravated me: it was as if you was a insect, and he was going to dab his finger-nail on you.‚Äù </p><p>  However, she said, ‚ÄúYour servant, sir,‚Äù and curtsied with an air of perfect deference as she advanced towards him: she was not the woman to misbehave towards her betters, and fly in the face of the catechism, without severe provocation. </p><p>  ‚ÄúIs your husband at home, Mrs. Poyser?‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúYes, sir; he‚Äôs only i‚Äô the rick-yard. I‚Äôll send for him in a minute, if you‚Äôll please to get down and step in.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúThank you; I will do so. I want to consult him about a little matter; but you are quite as much concerned in it, if not more. I must have your opinion too.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúHetty, run and tell your uncle to come in,‚Äù said Mrs. Poyser, as they entered the house, and the old gentleman bowed low in answer to Hetty‚Äôs curtsy; while Totty, conscious of a pinafore stained with gooseberry jam, stood hiding her face against the clock and peeping round furtively. </p><p>  ‚ÄúWhat a fine old kitchen this is!‚Äù said Mr. Donnithorne, looking round admiringly. He always spoke in the same deliberate, well-chiselled, polite way, whether his words were sugary or venomous. ‚ÄúAnd you keep it so exquisitely clean, Mrs. Poyser. I like these premises, do you know, beyond any on the estate.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúWell, sir, since you‚Äôre fond of ‚Äôem, I should be glad if you‚Äôd let a bit o‚Äô repairs be done to ‚Äôem, for the boarding‚Äôs i‚Äô that state as we‚Äôre like to be eaten up wi‚Äô rats and mice; and the cellar, you may stan‚Äô up to your knees i‚Äô water in‚Äôt, if you like to go down; but perhaps you‚Äôd rather believe my words. Won‚Äôt you please to sit down, sir?‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúNot yet; I must see your dairy. I have not seen it for years, and I hear on all hands about your fine cheese and butter,‚Äù said the squire, looking politely unconscious that there could be any question on which he and Mrs. Poyser might happen to disagree. ‚ÄúI think I see the door open, there. You must not be surprised if I cast a covetous eye on your cream and butter. I don‚Äôt expect that Mrs. Satchell‚Äôs cream and butter will bear comparison with yours.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say, sir, I‚Äôm sure. It‚Äôs seldom I see other folks‚Äôs butter, though there‚Äôs some on it as one‚Äôs no need to see‚Äîthe smell‚Äôs enough.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúAh, now this I like,‚Äù said Mr. Donnithorne, looking round at the damp temple of cleanliness, but keeping near the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I should like my breakfast better if I knew the butter and cream came from this dairy. Thank you, that really is a pleasant sight. Unfortunately, my slight tendency to rheumatism makes me afraid of damp: I‚Äôll sit down in your comfortable kitchen. Ah, Poyser, how do you do? In the midst of business, I see, as usual. I‚Äôve been looking at your wife‚Äôs beautiful dairy‚Äîthe best manager in the parish, is she not?‚Äù </p><p>  Mr. Poyser had just entered in shirt-sleeves and open waistcoat, with a face a shade redder than usual, from the exertion of ‚Äúpitching.‚Äù As he stood, red, rotund, and radiant, before the small, wiry, cool old gentleman, he looked like a prize apple by the side of a withered crab. </p><p>  ‚ÄúWill you please to take this chair, sir?‚Äù he said, lifting his father‚Äôs arm-chair forward a little: ‚Äúyou‚Äôll find it easy.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúNo, thank you, I never sit in easy-chairs,‚Äù said the old gentleman, seating himself on a small chair near the door. ‚ÄúDo you know, Mrs. Poyser‚Äîsit down, pray, both of you‚ÄîI‚Äôve been far from contented, for some time, with Mrs. Satchell‚Äôs dairy management. I think she has not a good method, as you have.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúIndeed, sir, I can‚Äôt speak to that,‚Äù said Mrs. Poyser in a hard voice, rolling and unrolling her knitting and looking icily out of the window, as she continued to stand opposite the squire. Poyser might sit down if he liked, she thought; <em>she</em> wasn‚Äôt going to sit down, as if she‚Äôd give in to any such smooth-tongued palaver. Mr. Poyser, who looked and felt the reverse of icy, did sit down in his three-cornered chair. </p><p>  ‚ÄúAnd now, Poyser, as Satchell is laid up, I am intending to let the Chase Farm to a respectable tenant. I‚Äôm tired of having a farm on my own hands‚Äînothing is made the best of in such cases, as you know. A satisfactory bailiff is hard to find; and I think you and I, Poyser, and your excellent wife here, can enter into a little arrangement in consequence, which will be to our mutual advantage.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said Mr. Poyser, with a good-natured blankness of imagination as to the nature of the arrangement. </p><p>  ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm called upon to speak, sir,‚Äù said Mrs. Poyser, after glancing at her husband with pity at his softness, ‚Äúyou know better than me; but I don‚Äôt see what the Chase Farm is t‚Äô us‚Äîwe‚Äôve cumber enough wi‚Äô our own farm. Not but what I‚Äôm glad to hear o‚Äô anybody respectable coming into the parish; there‚Äôs some as ha‚Äô been brought in as hasn‚Äôt been looked on i‚Äô that character.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre likely to find Mr. Thurle an excellent neighbour, I assure you‚Äîsuch a one as you will feel glad to have accommodated by the little plan I‚Äôm going to mention, especially as I hope you will find it as much to your own advantage as his.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúIndeed, sir, if it‚Äôs anything t‚Äô our advantage, it‚Äôll be the first offer o‚Äô the sort I‚Äôve heared on. It‚Äôs them as take advantage that get advantage i‚Äô this world, <em>I</em> think: folks have to wait long enough afore it‚Äôs brought to ‚Äôem.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúThe fact is, Poyser,‚Äù said the squire, ignoring Mrs. Poyser‚Äôs theory of worldly prosperity, ‚Äúthere is too much dairy land, and too little plough land, on the Chase Farm to suit Thurle‚Äôs purpose‚Äîindeed, he will only take the farm on condition of some change in it: his wife, it appears, is not a clever dairy-woman, like yours. Now, the plan I‚Äôm thinking of is to effect a little exchange. If you were to have the Hollow Pastures, you might increase your dairy, which must be so profitable under your wife‚Äôs management; and I should request you, Mrs. Poyser, to supply my house with milk, cream, and butter at the market prices. On the other hand, Poyser, you might let Thurle have the Lower and Upper Ridges, which really, with our wet seasons, would be a good riddance for you. There is much less risk in dairy land than corn land.‚Äù </p><p>  Mr. Poyser was leaning forward, with his elbows on his knees, his head on one side, and his mouth screwed up‚Äîapparently absorbed in making the tips of his fingers meet so as to represent with perfect accuracy the ribs of a ship. He was much too acute a man not to see through the whole business, and to foresee perfectly what would be his wife‚Äôs view of the subject; but he disliked giving unpleasant answers. Unless it was on a point of farming practice, he would rather give up than have a quarrel, any day; and, after all, it mattered more to his wife than to him. So, after a few moments‚Äô silence, he looked up at her and said mildly, ‚ÄúWhat dost say?‚Äù </p><p>  Mrs. Poyser had had her eyes fixed on her husband with cold severity during his silence, but now she turned away her head with a toss, looked icily at the opposite roof of the cow-shed, and spearing her knitting together with the loose pin, held it firmly between her clasped hands. </p><p>  ‚ÄúSay? Why, I say you may do as you like about giving up any o‚Äô your corn-land afore your lease is up, which it won‚Äôt be for a year come next Michaelmas, but I‚Äôll not consent to take more dairy work into my hands, either for love or money; and there‚Äôs nayther love nor money here, as I can see, on‚Äôy other folks‚Äôs love o‚Äô theirselves, and the money as is to go into other folks‚Äôs pockets. I know there‚Äôs them as is born t‚Äô own the land, and them as is born to sweat on‚Äôt‚Äù‚Äîhere Mrs. Poyser paused to gasp a little‚Äî‚Äúand I know it‚Äôs christened folks‚Äôs duty to submit to their betters as fur as flesh and blood ‚Äôull bear it; but I‚Äôll not make a martyr o‚Äô myself, and wear myself to skin and bone, and worret myself as if I was a churn wi‚Äô butter a-coming in‚Äôt, for no landlord in England, not if he was King George himself.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúNo, no, my dear Mrs. Poyser, certainly not,‚Äù said the squire, still confident in his own powers of persuasion, ‚Äúyou must not overwork yourself; but don‚Äôt you think your work will rather be lessened than increased in this way? There is so much milk required at the Abbey that you will have little increase of cheese and butter making from the addition to your dairy; and I believe selling the milk is the most profitable way of disposing of dairy produce, is it not?‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúAye, that‚Äôs true,‚Äù said Mr. Poyser, unable to repress an opinion on a question of farming profits, and forgetting that it was not in this case a purely abstract question. </p><p>  ‚ÄúI daresay,‚Äù said Mrs. Poyser bitterly, turning her head half-way towards her husband and looking at the vacant arm-chair‚Äî‚ÄúI daresay it‚Äôs true for men as sit i‚Äô th‚Äô chimney-corner and make believe as everything‚Äôs cut wi‚Äô ins an‚Äô outs to fit int‚Äô everything else. If you could make a pudding wi‚Äô thinking o‚Äô the batter, it ‚Äôud be easy getting dinner. How do I know whether the milk ‚Äôull be wanted constant? What‚Äôs to make me sure as the house won‚Äôt be put o‚Äô board wage afore we‚Äôre many months older, and then I may have to lie awake o‚Äô nights wi‚Äô twenty gallons o‚Äô milk on my mind‚Äîand Dingall ‚Äôull take no more butter, let alone paying for it; and we must fat pigs till we‚Äôre obliged to beg the butcher on our knees to buy ‚Äôem, and lose half of ‚Äôem wi‚Äô the measles. And there‚Äôs the fetching and carrying, as ‚Äôud be welly half a day‚Äôs work for a man an‚Äô hoss‚Äî<em>that‚Äôs</em> to be took out o‚Äô the profits, I reckon? But there‚Äôs folks ‚Äôud hold a sieve under the pump and expect to carry away the water.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúThat difficulty‚Äîabout the fetching and carrying‚Äîyou will not have, Mrs. Poyser,‚Äù said the squire, who thought that this entrance into particulars indicated a distant inclination to compromise on Mrs. Poyser‚Äôs part. ‚ÄúBethell will do that regularly with the cart and pony.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúOh, sir, begging your pardon, I‚Äôve never been used t‚Äô having gentlefolks‚Äôs servants coming about my back places, a-making love to both the gells at once and keeping ‚Äôem with their hands on their hips listening to all manner o‚Äô gossip when they should be down on their knees a-scouring. If we‚Äôre to go to ruin, it shanna be wi‚Äô having our back kitchen turned into a public.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúWell, Poyser,‚Äù said the squire, shifting his tactics and looking as if he thought Mrs. Poyser had suddenly withdrawn from the proceedings and left the room, ‚Äúyou can turn the Hollows into feeding-land. I can easily make another arrangement about supplying my house. And I shall not forget your readiness to accommodate your landlord as well as a neighbour. I know you will be glad to have your lease renewed for three years, when the present one expires; otherwise, I daresay Thurle, who is a man of some capital, would be glad to take both the farms, as they could be worked so well together. But I don‚Äôt want to part with an old tenant like you.‚Äù </p><p>  To be thrust out of the discussion in this way would have been enough to complete Mrs. Poyser‚Äôs exasperation, even without the final threat. Her husband, really alarmed at the possibility of their leaving the old place where he had been bred and born‚Äîfor he believed the old squire had small spite enough for anything‚Äîwas beginning a mild remonstrance explanatory of the inconvenience he should find in having to buy and sell more stock, with, ‚ÄúWell, sir, I think as it‚Äôs rether hard...‚Äù when Mrs. Poyser burst in with the desperate determination to have her say out this once, though it were to rain notices to quit and the only shelter were the work-house. </p><p>  ‚ÄúThen, sir, if I may speak‚Äîas, for all I‚Äôm a woman, and there‚Äôs folks as thinks a woman‚Äôs fool enough to stan‚Äô by an‚Äô look on while the men sign her soul away, I‚Äôve a right to speak, for I make one quarter o‚Äô the rent, and save another quarter‚ÄîI say, if Mr. Thurle‚Äôs so ready to take farms under you, it‚Äôs a pity but what he should take this, and see if he likes to live in a house wi‚Äô all the plagues o‚Äô Egypt in‚Äôt‚Äîwi‚Äô the cellar full o‚Äô water, and frogs and toads hoppin‚Äô up the steps by dozens‚Äîand the floors rotten, and the rats and mice gnawing every bit o‚Äô cheese, and runnin‚Äô over our heads as we lie i‚Äô bed till we expect ‚Äôem to eat us up alive‚Äîas it‚Äôs a mercy they hanna eat the children long ago. I should like to see if there‚Äôs another tenant besides Poyser as ‚Äôud put up wi‚Äô never having a bit o‚Äô repairs done till a place tumbles down‚Äîand not then, on‚Äôy wi‚Äô begging and praying and having to pay half‚Äîand being strung up wi‚Äô the rent as it‚Äôs much if he gets enough out o‚Äô the land to pay, for all he‚Äôs put his own money into the ground beforehand. See if you‚Äôll get a stranger to lead such a life here as that: a maggot must be born i‚Äô the rotten cheese to like it, I reckon. You may run away from my words, sir,‚Äù continued Mrs. Poyser, following the old squire beyond the door‚Äîfor after the first moments of stunned surprise he had got up, and, waving his hand towards her with a smile, had walked out towards his pony. But it was impossible for him to get away immediately, for John was walking the pony up and down the yard, and was some distance from the causeway when his master beckoned. </p><p>  ‚ÄúYou may run away from my words, sir, and you may go spinnin‚Äô underhand ways o‚Äô doing us a mischief, for you‚Äôve got Old Harry to your friend, though nobody else is, but I tell you for once as we‚Äôre not dumb creatures to be abused and made money on by them as ha‚Äô got the lash i‚Äô their hands, for want o‚Äô knowing how t‚Äô undo the tackle. An‚Äô if I‚Äôm th‚Äô only one as speaks my mind, there‚Äôs plenty o‚Äô the same way o‚Äô thinking i‚Äô this parish and the next to ‚Äôt, for your name‚Äôs no better than a brimstone match in everybody‚Äôs nose‚Äîif it isna two-three old folks as you think o‚Äô saving your soul by giving ‚Äôem a bit o‚Äô flannel and a drop o‚Äô porridge. An‚Äô you may be right i‚Äô thinking it‚Äôll take but little to save your soul, for it‚Äôll be the smallest savin‚Äô y‚Äô iver made, wi‚Äô all your scrapin‚Äô.‚Äù </p><p>  There are occasions on which two servant-girls and a waggoner may be a formidable audience, and as the squire rode away on his black pony, even the gift of short-sightedness did not prevent him from being aware that Molly and Nancy and Tim were grinning not far from him. Perhaps he suspected that sour old John was grinning behind him‚Äîwhich was also the fact. Meanwhile the bull-dog, the black-and-tan terrier, Alick‚Äôs sheep-dog, and the gander hissing at a safe distance from the pony‚Äôs heels carried out the idea of Mrs. Poyser‚Äôs solo in an impressive quartet. </p><p>  Mrs. Poyser, however, had no sooner seen the pony move off than she turned round, gave the two hilarious damsels a look which drove them into the back kitchen, and unspearing her knitting, began to knit again with her usual rapidity as she re-entered the house. </p><p>  ‚ÄúThee‚Äôst done it now,‚Äù said Mr. Poyser, a little alarmed and uneasy, but not without some triumphant amusement at his wife‚Äôs outbreak. </p><p>  ‚ÄúYes, I know I‚Äôve done it,‚Äù said Mrs. Poyser; ‚Äúbut I‚Äôve had my say out, and I shall be th‚Äô easier for‚Äôt all my life. There‚Äôs no pleasure i‚Äô living if you‚Äôre to be corked up for ever, and only dribble your mind out by the sly, like a leaky barrel. I shan‚Äôt repent saying what I think, if I live to be as old as th‚Äô old squire; and there‚Äôs little likelihood‚Äîfor it seems as if them as aren‚Äôt wanted here are th‚Äô only folks as aren‚Äôt wanted i‚Äô th‚Äô other world.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúBut thee wutna like moving from th‚Äô old place, this Michaelmas twelvemonth,‚Äù said Mr. Poyser, ‚Äúand going into a strange parish, where thee know‚Äôst nobody. It‚Äôll be hard upon us both, and upo‚Äô Father too.‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúEh, it‚Äôs no use worreting; there‚Äôs plenty o‚Äô things may happen between this and Michaelmas twelvemonth. The captain may be master afore them, for what we know,‚Äù said Mrs. Poyser, inclined to take an unusually hopeful view of an embarrassment which had been brought about by her own merit and not by other people‚Äôs fault. </p><p>  ‚Äú<em>I‚Äôm</em> none for worreting,‚Äù said Mr. Poyser, rising from his three-cornered chair and walking slowly towards the door; ‚Äúbut I should be loath to leave th‚Äô old place, and the parish where I was bred and born, and Father afore me. We should leave our roots behind us, I doubt, and niver thrive again.‚Äù</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/ai_summary_chen/Adam Bede/BOOK IV/Chapter XXXI"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">XXXI.

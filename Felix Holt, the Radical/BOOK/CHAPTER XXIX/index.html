The chapter begins with an elaborate metaphor comparing the game of chess to the game a man has to play with his fellow-men. It then introduces Matthew Jermyn and Johnson, whose relationship is strained due to Jermyn&#x27;s arrogance and condescension. Johnson has been acting as a double agent during the election, subtly working against Harold Transome. Both Christian and Johnson have been independently investigating the possible claim of Bycliffe on the Transome estates. Johnson has a deeper understanding of the legal implications, but both are hindered by their lack of knowledge about each other.</p><p><strong>Main Characters</strong>:

<!-- -->[&#x27;The chess metaphor at the beginning of the chapter is significant as it sets the tone for the power dynamics and manipulations that unfold in the chapter.&#x27;, &quot;The strained relationship between Jermyn and Johnson, and Johnson&#x27;s subsequent actions, highlight the theme of duplicity and manipulation.&quot;, &quot;Both Christian and Johnson&#x27;s investigations into Bycliffe&#x27;s potential claim add an element of legal intrigue to the story.&quot;]</p></div></div><p>I doe believe that, as the gall has severall receptacles in several creatures, soe there&#x27;s scarce any creature but hath that emunctorye somewhere.--SIR THOMAS BROWNE. </p><p>Fancy what a game at chess would be if all the chessmen had passions and intellects, more or less small and cunning: if you were not only uncertain about your adversary&#x27;s men, but a little uncertain about your own; if your knight could shuffle himself on to a new square by the sly; if your bishop, in disgust at your castling, could wheedle your pawns out of their places; and if your pawns, hating you because they are pawns, could make away from their appointed posts that you might get checkmate on a sudden. You might be the longest-headed of deductive reasoners, and yet you might be beaten by your own pawns. You would be especially likely to be beat, if you depended arrogantly on your mathematical imagination, and regarded your passionate pieces with contempt. </p><p>Yet this imaginary chess is easy compared with the game a man has to play against his fellow-men with other fellow-men for his instruments. He thinks himself sagacious, perhaps, because he trusts no bond except that of self-interest: but the only self-interest he can safely rely on is what seems to be such to the mind he would use or govern. Can he ever be sure of knowing this? </p><p>Matthew Jermyn was under no misgivings as to the fealty of Johnson. He had &quot;been the making of Johnson&quot;; and this seems to many men as a reason for expecting devotion, in spite of the fact that they themselves, though very fond of their own persons and lives, are not at all devoted to the Maker they believe in. Johnson was a most serviceable subordinate. Being a man who aimed at respectability, a family man, who had a good church-pew, subscribed for engravings of banquet pictures where there were portraits of political celebrities, and wished his children to be more unquestionably genteel than their father, he presented all the more numerous handles of worldly motive by which a judicious superior might get a hold on him. But this useful regard to respectability had its inconvenience in relation to such a superior: it was a mark of some vanity and some pride, which, if they were not touched just in the right handling-place, were liable to become raw and sensitive. Jermyn was aware of Johnson&#x27;s weaknesses, and thought he had flattered them sufficiently. But on the point of knowing when we are disagreeable, our human nature is fallible. Our lavender-water, our smiles, our compliments, and other polite falsities, are constantly offensive, when in the very nature of them they can only be meant to attract admiration and regard. Jermyn had often been unconsciously disagreeable to Johnson, over and above the constant offence of being an ostentatious patron. He would never let Johnson dine with his wife and daughters; he would not himself dine at Johnson&#x27;s house when he was in town. He often did what was equivalent to poohpoohing his conversation by not even appearing to listen, and by suddenly cutting it short with a query on a new subject. Jermyn was able and politic enough to have commanded a great deal of success in his life, but he could not help being handsome, arrogant, fond of being heard, indisposed to any kind of comradeship, amorous and bland toward women, cold and self-contained toward men. You will hear very strong denials that an attorney&#x27;s being handsome could enter into the dislike he excited; but conversation consists a good deal in the denial of what is true. From the British point of view masculine beauty is regarded very much as it is in the drapery business:--as good solely for the fancy department--for young noblemen, artists, poets, and the clergy. Some one who, like Mr. Lingon, was disposed to revile Jermyn (perhaps it was Sir Maximus), had called him &quot;a cursed, sleek, handsome, long-winded, overbearing sycophant&quot;; epithets which expressed, rather confusedly, the mingled character of the dislike he excited. And serviceable John Johnson, himself sleek, and mindful about his broadcloth and his cambric fronts, had what he considered &quot;spirit&quot; enough within him to feel that dislike of Jermyn gradually gathering force through years of obligation and subjection, till it had become an actuating motive disposed to use an opportunity; if it did not watch for one. </p><p>It was not this motive, however, but rather the ordinary course of business, which accounted for Johnson&#x27;s playing a double part as an electioneering agent. What men do in elections is not to be classed either among sins or marks of grace; it would be profane to include business in religion, and conscience refers to failure, not to success. Still, the sense of being galled by Jermyn&#x27;s harness was an additional reason for cultivating all relations that were independent of him; and pique at Harold Transome&#x27;s behavior to him in Jermyn&#x27;s office perhaps gave all the more zest to Johnson&#x27;s use of his pen and ink when he wrote a handbill in the service of Garstin, and Garstin&#x27;s incomparable agent, Putty, full of innuendoes against Harold Transome, as a descendant of the Durfey-Transomes. It is a natural subject of self-congratulation to a man, when special knowledge, gained long ago without any forecast, turns out to afford a special inspiration in the present; and Johnson felt a new pleasure in the consciousness that he of all people in the world next to Jermyn had the most intimate knowledge of the Transome affairs. Still better--some of these affairs were secrets of Jermyn&#x27;s. If in an uncomplimentary spirit he might have been called Jermyn&#x27;s &quot;man of straw,&quot; it was a satisfaction to know that the unreality of the man John Johnson was confined to his appearance in annuity deeds, and that elsewhere he was solid, locomotive, and capable of remembering anything for his own pleasure and benefit. To act with doubleness towards a man whose conduct was double, was so near an approach to virtue that it deserved to be called by no meaner name than diplomacy. </p><p>By such causes it came to pass that Christian held in his hands a bill in which Jermyn was playfully alluded to as Mr. German Cozen, who won games by clever shuffling and odd tricks without any honor, and backed Durfey&#x27;s crib against Bycliffe--in which it was adroitly implied that the so-called head of the Transomes was only the tail of the Durfeys--and that some said the Durfeys would have died out and left their nest empty if it had not been for their German Cozen. </p><p>Johnson had not dared to use any recollections except such as might credibly exist in other minds besides his own. In the truth of the case, no one but himself had the prompting to recall these out-worn scandals; but it was likely enough that such foul-winged things should be revived by election heats for Johnson to escape all suspicion. </p><p>Christian could gather only dim and uncertain inferences from this flat irony and heavy joking; but one chief thing was clear to him. He had been right in his conjecture that Jermyn&#x27;s interest about Bycliffe had its source in some claim of Bycliffe&#x27;s on the Transome property. And then, there was that story of the old bill-sticker&#x27;s, which, closely considered, indicated that the right of the present Transomes depended, or, at least, had depended on the continuance of some other lives. Christian in his time had gathered enough legal notions to be aware that possession by one man sometimes depended on the life of another; that a man might sell his own interest in property, and the interest of his descendants, while a claim on that property would still remain to some one else than the purchaser, supposing the descendants became extinct, and the interests they had sold were at an end. But under what conditions the claim might be valid or void in any particular case, was all darkness to him. Suppose Bycliffe had any such claim on the Transome estates: how was Christian to know whether at the present moment it was worth anything more than a bit of rotten parchment? Old Tommy Trounsem had said that Johnson knew all about it. But even if Johnson were still above-ground--and all Johnsons are mortal--he might still be an understrapper of Jermyn&#x27;s, in which case his knowledge would be on the wrong side of the hedge for the purposes of Henry Scaddon. His immediate care must be to find out all he could about Johnson. He blamed himself for not having questioned Tommy further while he had him at command; but on this head the bill-sticker could hardly know more than the less dilapidated denizens of Treby. </p><p>Now it had happened that during the weeks in which Christian had been at work trying to solve the enigma of Jermyn&#x27;s interest about Bycliffe, Johnson&#x27;s mind also had been somewhat occupied with suspicion and conjecture as to new information on the subject of the old Bycliffe claims which Jermyn intended to conceal from him. The letter which, after his interview with Christian, Jermyn had written with a sense of perfect safety to his faithful ally Johnson, was, as we know, written to a Johnson who had found his self-love incompatible with that faithfulness of which it was supposed to be the foundation. Anything that the patron felt it inconvenient for his obliged friend and servant to know, became by that very fact an object of peculiar curiosity. The obliged friend and servant secretly doted on his patron&#x27;s inconvenience, provided that he himself did not share it; and conjecture naturally became active. </p><p>Johnson&#x27;s legal imagination, being very differently furnished from Christian&#x27;s, was at no loss to conceive conditions under which there might arise a new claim on the Transome estates. He had before him the whole history of the settlement of those estates made a hundred years ago by John Justus Transome, entailing them, whilst in his possession, on his son Thomas and his heirs-male, with remainder to the Bycliffes in fee. He knew that Thomas, son of John Justus, proving a prodigal, had, without the knowledge of his father, the tenant in possession, sold his own and his descendants&#x27; rights to a lawyer-cousin named Durfey; that, therefore, the title of the Durfey-Transomes, in spite of that old Durfey&#x27;s tricks to show the contrary, depended solely on the purchase of the &quot;base fee&quot; thus created by Thomas Transome; and that the Bycliffes were the &quot;remainder men&quot; who might fairly oust the Durfey-Transomes if ever the issue of the prodigal Thomas went clean out of existence, and ceased to represent a right which he had bargained away from them. </p><p>Johnson, as Jermyn&#x27;s subordinate, had been closely cognizant of the details concerning the suit instituted by successive Bycliffes, of whom Maurice Christian Bycliffe was the last, on the plea that the extinction of Thomas Transome&#x27;s line had actually come to pass--a weary suit, which had eaten into the fortunes of two families, and had only made the cankerworms fat. The suit had closed with the death of Maurice Christian Bycliffe in prison; but before his death, Jermyn&#x27;s exertions to get evidence that there was still issue of Thomas Transome&#x27;s line surviving, as a security of the Durfey title, had issued in the discovery of a Thomas Transome at Littleshaw, in Stonyshire, who was the representative of the pawned inheritance. The death of Maurice had made this discovery useless--had made it seem the wiser part to say nothing about it; and the fact had remained a secret known only to Jermyn and Johnson. No other Bycliffe was known or believed to exist, and the Durfey-Transomes might be considered safe, unless--yes, there was an &quot;unless&quot; which Johnson could conceive: an heir or heiress of the Bycliffes--if such a personage turned out to be in existence--might sometime raise a new and valid claim when once informed that wretched old Tommy Trounsem the bill-sticker, tottering drunkenly on the edge of the grave, was the last issue remaining above-ground from that dissolute Thomas who played his Esau part a century before. While the poor old bill-sticker breathed, the Durfey-Transomes could legally keep their possession in spite of a possible Bycliffe proved real; but not when the parish had buried the bill-sticker. </p><p>Still, it is one thing to conceive conditions, and another to see any chance of proving their existence. Johnson at present had no glimpse of such a chance; and even if he ever gained the glimpse, he was not sure that he should ever make any use of it. His enquiries of Medwin, in obedience to Jermyn&#x27;s letter, had extracted only a negative as to any information possessed by the lawyers of Bycliffe concerning a marriage, or expectation of offspring on his part. But Johnson felt not the less stung by curiosity to know what Jermyn had found out: that he had found something in relation to a possible Bycliffe, Johnson felt pretty sure. And he thought with satisfaction that Jermyn could not hinder him from knowing what he already knew about Thomas Transome&#x27;s issue. Many things might occur to alter his policy and give a new value to facts. Was it certain that Jermyn would always be fortunate? </p><p>When greed and unscrupulousness exhibit themselves on a grand historical scale, and there is a question of peace or war or amicable partition, it often occurs that gentlemen of high diplomatic talents have their minds bent on the same object from different points of view. Each, perhaps, is thinking of a certain duchy or province, with a view to arranging the ownership in such a way as shall best serve the purposes of the gentleman with high diplomatic talents in whom each is more especially interested. But these select minds in high office can never miss their aims from ignorance of each other&#x27;s existence or whereabouts. Their high titles may be learned even by common people from every pocket almanac. </p><p>But with meaner diplomats, who might be mutually useful, such ignorance is often obstructive. Mr. John Johnson and Mr. Christian, otherwise Mr. Scaddon, might have had a concentration of purpose and an ingenuity of device fitting them to make a figure in the parcelling of Europe, and yet they might never have met, simply because Johnson knew nothing of Christian, and because Christian did not know where to find Johnson.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/ai_summary_chen/Felix Holt, the Radical/BOOK/CHAPTER XXVIII"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">CHAPTER XXVIII.</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/ai_summary_chen/Felix Holt, the Radical/BOOK/CHAPTER XXX"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">CHAPTER XXX.</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#chapter-xxix" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div>
